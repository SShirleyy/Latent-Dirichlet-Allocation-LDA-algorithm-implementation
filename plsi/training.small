EAST EUROPE WHEAT WINTERKILL POSSIBLE, ACCU SAYS Winter wheat crops in the western Soviet Union, Poland and eastern Czechoslovakia through northern Romania may suffer some winterkill over the next two nights, private forecaster Accu-Weather Inc said. Western USSR winter wheat areas have had only light and spotty snow and winterkill is possible tonight and tomorrow night as temperatures drop to minus 10 to 0 degrees F. Snow cover is scant in Poland, with only about 50 pct of the winter wheat areas reporting one to two inches of snow as of this morning. The remaining 50 pct of winter wheat crops do not have snow cover, making winterkill possible on each of the next two nights. Lowest temperatures will be minus 10 to 0 degrees F. Winter wheat areas from eastern Czechoslovakia through northern Romania had light snow flurries yesterday and last night, but amounts were an inch or less. With temperatures expected to fall to near 0 degrees F over the next two nights, some light winterkill is possible, Accu-Weather added.

CIBA-GEIGY, PHILLIPS PETROLEUM IN JOINT VENTURE Ciba-Geigy AG &lt;CIGZ.Z> said it would establish a joint venture with Phillips Petroleum Co. In Europe to manufacture a high performance engineering thermoplastic. Initially, the Swiss chemicals firm will manufacture polyphenylene sulfide compounds using resins from Phillips. The two firms will later set up a joint venture to produce the polyphenylene resins and compounds, which will be marketed independently under their respective trademarks. A Ciba-Geigy spokesman declined to say how much the venture would cost. Polyphenylene sulfide is widely used in the electronic, automotive, and petroleum fields.

Harleysville plans to invest about four mln dlrs in the business if the deal is completed.  
GENCORP &lt;GY> PROPOSALS WITHDRAWN FROM MEETING GenCorp Inc said it withdrew from consideration at its annual meeting on March 31 proposals aimed at providing for a stock split and an increased dividend so that it could focus its energies on responding to the takeover offer made last week by a partnership of AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner and Brown. In addition to proposing an increase in the number of its outstanding common shares, GenCorp had suggested the adoption of a classified or "staggered" board and the elimination of cumulative voting. GenCorp said these proposals could "distract energy and attention from the real task at hand -- to respond to the tender offer in a manner which is in the best interests of the company, its shareholders and its other constituencies." GenCorp said the proposal to increase its outstanding shares was made with the aim of declaring a stock split and a dividend increase. The other proposals, it said, would provide for greater long-term stability and cohesiveness for the GenCorp board. The company did not indicate when it might resubmit the proposals for approval by its shareholders.

"We're going to reduce AI to a size consistent with our financial resources," said Chairman Oliver S. Travers. "We have made a conscious, strategic choice to become a smaller, financially sound, consumer products company which operates predominantly in the stable political and economic environment of North America," he said.   
INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). "The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86. Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said. The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year. But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said. One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering. The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails. "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India," a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible. "We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India," the trade official said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said. Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission. In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct sought by New Delhi, the trade official said. "We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest," he added. Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars. But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some inherent problems, they added. "It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced," one trade source said. "The other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants." Another added, "Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty. "This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India. It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy."  
U.S. BUSINESS LOANS FALL 618 MLN DLRS Business loans on the books of major U.S. banks, excluding acceptances, fell 618 mln dlrs to 278.88 billion dlrs in the week ended February 25, the Federal Reserve Board said.

U.S. TO ASK JAPAN TO DROP BEEF RESTRICTIONS U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will ask the Japanese Government to remove all beef import restrictions when he visits there next month. Lyng's remarks came in a speech at Oklahoma State University today. "We think Japanese consumers should have the same freedom of choice as our consumers. Look at all the Japanese cameras and tape recorders in this room. We know they'd buy more beef if they had the opportunity," Lyng said.  
INVESTMENT GROUP RAISES ROBESON &lt;RBSN> STAKE A group of affiliated Miami-based investment firms led by Fundamental Management Corp said it raised its stake in Robeson Industries Corp to 238,000 shares, or 14.6 pct of the total, from 205,000 or 12.8 pct. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said it bought 32,800 Robeson common shares between Jan 26 and Feb 9 for 175,691 dlrs. The group said it may buy more shares and plans to study Robeson's operations. Afterwards it may recommend that management make changes in its operations. Fundamental Management Chairman Carl Singer was recently elected to the Robeson board.

U.S. ECONOMY SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS OF GROWTH The U.S. economy is showing some promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, private economists say. Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year, as the tax law changes that went into effect in January slowed business and consumer spending. But some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the U.S. economy, although some economists remain cautious about the outlook. The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for durable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pct rise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defense goods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agency said. The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct. The January/February employment statistics suggest the Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct, the lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farm jobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in January and a 225,000 December increase, the government said. The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of about three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley. Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending. He also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi-family housing units. Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue. Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the first quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter and show a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter. The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the U.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollar's value over the last year and half. "The improvement will be gradual and long lasting," Levy predicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but at least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the prices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas. The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit, which soared to record levels last year, will improve this year and the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the year compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year. As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S. has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others. U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the United States whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries. The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt. The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a modest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter. There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the United States and those shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume of exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986. While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporate profits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, the government said. It also reported that inflation, as measured by the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing a moderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years. The government also reported that consumer spending, a key element of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct in February, after falling two pct in January. The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the manufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elements of the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery. In its latest report on current economic conditions, the Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving. Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish. Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the pick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a major pick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either. He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power. "That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of years," Chimerine said. He sees economic growth hovering around a modest two pct level for the next few years.  
U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 800 MLN STG The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 800 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 1.61 billion stg. Partly offsetting this outflow, exchequer transactions and a fall in note circulation will add around 425 mln stg and 360 mln stg respectively. In addition, bankers' balances above target will add some 20 mln stg to the system today.  
FEBRUARY U.S. JOBS GAINS SHOW STRONGER ECONOMY Momentum in th U.S. economy may be picking up given solid across-the board increases in the February U.S. employment report, economists said. U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February, twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a 319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 448,000 increase. "Even if you look at January and February together, this is still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in the market," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation. Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much larger gains in February U.S. production and income than previously forecast. The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from 34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose 0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since November 1966, the Commerce Department said. "The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7 pct," said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4 pct  gain in January U.S. industrial production. Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour in February from 8.83 dlrs in January. "Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means we'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis the wage and salary disbursement," he said. Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January. He said the February employment gains are consistent with his firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national product growth forecast of 3.7 pct. Economists agreed that the employment data were negative for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy and no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. But most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either. "This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider easing," said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. "It gives them more room to address the dollar situation," he said. "If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so, but it's most likely they'll sit and wait." "The data have not been uniform," Stone added. "Durable goods were weak in January and now employment is strong." In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct, followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S. retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap widened to 14.8 billion dlrs. "Things just aren't adding up," said Steve Slifer of Lehman Goverment Securities Inc. "Consumer spending, capital spending, goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first quarter GNP growth of one pct," he said. "The employment and production data point to a big inventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourth quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth." Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000 in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery industries returning to work. Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains have resulted from an improving trade outlook. Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S. trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve in the first quarter. "Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter, but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show that trade is improving," Benderley said. "The economy is moving between extremes," he said. "Some reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct." A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater part of February's employment gain. Retail services employment rose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in January, previously reported at 166,000. Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 142,000 gain. The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in February at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at 6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since March 1980, the Commerce Department noted. "The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report," Carson said. "This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease, but there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that."  
WICKES &lt;WIX> PLANS REVERSE SPLIT, CALLS DEBT Wickes Cos Inc said its board authorized a one-for-five reverse stock split and plans to call the company's its 12 pct senior subordianted debentures due 1994. The company said it will seek shareholder approval of the reverse stock split at the annual shareholders meeting scheduled for June 18. At January 31 Wickes had 239 mln shares outstanding, the company also said. Wickes also said it will call the debentures on Dec 1, 1987, assuming market conditions remain essentially the same.  
AGENCY RENT-A-CAR &lt;AGNC> SETS STOCK DIVIDEND Agency Rent-A-Car Inc said its board declared a five pct stock dividend, payable May 22 to holders of record on May 8. The company also said it plans to increase the size of its rental fleet in the year ending January 31 by 20 to 25 pct and expand its rental office network.  
OSR &lt;OSRC> TO MAKE ACQUISITION OSR Corp said it has agreed to acquire the properties and assets of Telcom International Group for 10.5 mln common shares, which would give former Telcom owners an 84 pct interest in the combined company. Telcom is an international film and television distributor. The assets being acquired consist mostly of distribution rights to films valued at over one mln dlrs, the company said. OSR said as part of the acquisition agreement is is required to sell its 80 pct interest in Standard Knickerbocker Ltd, which makes jeans in Canada. OSR said it expects to net about 150,000 dlrs on the sale of Standard Knickerbocker. The company said both transactions are subject to approval by shareholders at a meeting to be held in April or May, it said.  
YANKEE COS &lt;YNK> UNIT TO SELL ASSSETS Yankee Cos Inc's Eskey Inc &lt;ESK> subsidiary said it reached an agreement in principle to sell its Eskey's Yale E. Key Inc subsidiary to a new concern formed by Key's management and a private investor for about 15.5 mln dlrs. As part of sale, Eskey said the buyers will assume the 14.5 mln dlrs of publicly held Eskey 10-3/4 pct debentures due 2003. It said the debentures will continue to be converted into Yankee preferred. The remainder of the price will be a one mln dlr note to Eskey. Yankee said the sale will result in a loss of 1.5 mln dlrs.  
ANZ BANK IN N.Z. RAISES INDICATOR LENDING RATE The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd in New Zealand said it will raise its indicator lending rate to 23 pct from 21.5 pct on April 7. A bank statement said the continuing rise in the cost of funds had to be passed on to the lending customers. ANZ managing director Brian Weeks said: "Recent developments in the money markets are of deep concern to all participants ... Market participants are understandably nervous and cautious about future developments. These include flows to and from the government relating to the privatisation of seven government departments on April 1. "We welcome the flexibility evident in the Reserve Bank's move to raise the system cash target yesterday, but feel that to reduce the present nervousness the cash target and primary liquidity level need to be raised further...," he said. The Reserve Bank has raised its daily cash target to 45 mln N.Z. Dlrs from its normal 30 mln dlrs. Call rates have traded as high as 65 pct this week because of business year-end March 31 balance date book squaring. Westpac Banking Corp in New Zealand announced yesterday it would increase its indicator lending rate by 1.5 percentage points to 22.5 pct on April 7.

VARITY &lt;VAT> EXPECTS 4TH QTR, FULL-YEAR LOSS Varity Corp, formerly Massey-Ferguson Ltd, said it expected to report on March 25 a loss for the fourth quarter and full-year ended January 31. A company spokesman said specific figures were unavailable. Varity posted a net profit of 3.9 mln U.S. dlrs for the previous fiscal year ended January 31, 1986 and a 3.3 mln dlr net profit for the previous fourth quarter. Its net loss for the nine months ended October 31 totaled 4.7 mln dlrs after a 19.7 mln dlr third quarter loss tied to strikes and plant shutdowns at its British and French operations. Varity also said it would seek shareholder approval at a special shareholders' meeting on April 9 to authorize a transfer of values to the contributed surplus account on its balance sheet from the stated capital account for common shares. The spokesman said the move would help raise company values required to pay dividends under Canadian law.

ST LAWRENCE SEAWAY OPENS SHIPPING SEASON The St Lawrence Seaway said the first ship of the season passed through the St Lambert lock here this morning, officially opening the 2,300-mile-long waterway's 1987 shipping season. The seaway has said it expects little increase in freight levels this year from last year when it moved 37.6 mln tonnes of freight between Montreal and Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tonnes on the Welland Canal, which links Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The canal is scheduled to open tomorrow. Officials expect the waterway to lose nine to ten mln Canadian dlrs this year, about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal 1986-87, which ends today.

COASTAL &lt;CGP> SAYS TRANSAMERICAN SUIT FRIVOLOUS Coastal Corp said it belives the two billion dlr suit against it by &lt;TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp> in Texas state court is frivolous and without merit. The company said it intends toi proceed with filing a reorganization plan for TransAmerican with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. Yesterday afternoon, the bankruptcy court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting TransAmerican and Coastal from taking any action in any court that would interfere with the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. Yesterday's bankruptcy court ruling affirmed Coastal's rights as a TransAmerican creditor to file a reorganization plan for TransAmerican. TransAmerican's suit alleges that Coastla attempted to unlawfully gain control of TransAmerican's Texas natural gas reserves and pipeline system. TransAmerican's bankruptcy proceedings began in 1983.  
USAIR &lt;U> AND UNIT REMAIN UNDER MOODY'S REVIEW Moody's Investors Service Inc said the 212.75 mln dlrs of debt of USAir Group Inc and its USAir Inc unit remain under review for possible downgrade. The rating agency cited USAir Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE>, as well as Trans World Airlines Inc's &lt;TWA> proposed cash merger with USAir. However, the status of TWA's bid for USAir Group is currently uncertain. The U.S. Transportation Department has rejected TWA's application to acquire USAir on deficiency grounds, but TWA has said it will file a revised application, Moody's noted. Under Moody's review for possible downgrade are USAir Group's Baa-1 senior debt and Baa-2 subordinated debentures, along with the USAir unit's A-3 senior debt and Baa-1 subordinated debentures. Moody's said it would examine the effects of the proposed mergers on USAir Group's financial measurements, as well as potential damage to the company's financial flexibility because of the probability of increased debt-service requirements.

ARAB BANKER SAYS TOO SOON FOR SINGLE CURRENCY Gulf Arab states must coordinate economic policies more closely before moving towards their goal of a unified currency system, the President of the Arab Bankers Association said. Hikmat Nashashibi told a news conference at the end of an Arab currency traders meeting: "We have to start with coordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a common system of currencies ... There is quite a substantial way to go yet." He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be a plausible project. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates --  have held a series of meetings this year to examine linking their currencies to a single peg in a system which bankers say could be modelled on the European Monetary System (EMS). At present, five currencies are linked either officially or in practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar is pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies. A common currency system or EMS-style "grid" would, in theory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable exchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain small. "Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their infancy," he said. Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, a paucity of financial instruments and a legal framework that often does not recognise the western banking concept of interest have hampered the growth of Arab markets.  
U.S. SAYS NO PACT ON RELIEF FOR POOREST STATES There is no consensus so far among industrial countries on an agreement providing debt relief for the world's poorest nations, a senior U.S. Treasury official said. The official said, "There has not been a consensus reached yet," when asked about reports the Paris club of western creditors had agreed to long-term stretch outs of African debt at concessional interest rates. The official, briefing reporters on this week's semiannual IMF meetings, said the issue would be discussed this week and the U.S. had an open mind on the proposal but it did object to concessional interest rate relief.

BANK OF ENGLAND DOES NOT INTERVENE IN MONEY MARKET The Bank of England said it did not operate in the money market during the morning. Initially, the bank forecast a liqudity shortage of some 300 mln stg for the market today. Overnight interbank sterling traded at the 11-1/4 1/8 pct level for most of the morning while period rates have eased on the strength of sterling, dealers said. At 1200 gmt, sterling's trade-weighted index was up 0.6 at 72.7.

INVESTMENT ADVISORS HAVE 10 PCT OF KILLEARN&lt;KPI> Two executives of a Memphis, Tenn., investment advisory firm told the Securities and Exchange Commission they have acquired 132,000 shares of Killearn Properties Inc, or 10.4 pct of the total outstanding. The executives, O. Mason Hawkins and William Reid, who work for Southeastern Asset Management Inc, said they bought their Killearn stock with personal funds as an investment. While they said they might increase their stake Killearn Properties, they said they have no plans to seek control of it.  
GERMAN SUGAR OFFERS PUT AT ABOUT 100,000 TONNES The West German intervention board said about 100,000 tonnes of sugar have been offered into intervention so far. A spokesman, speaking from Frankfurt, told Reuters offers have increased recently but contracts have not yet been concluded. A European Commission spokesman in Brussels earlier confirmed that one mln tonnes of sugar had been offered to intervention boards in various member states. The intervention board spokesman in Frankfurt said, "One million tonnes is an awful lot and the Community's coffers are almost empty. This could turn into a serious political problem." West German trade sources said they believed the one mln tonne offer by the EC sugar industry into intervention would have a neutral market impact overall.

CARGILL OFFICIAL DEFENDS CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS The use of generic in-kind commodity certificates has helped ease storage problems and is a necessary part of export promotion programs, a senior executive for the world's largest grain company said. Testifying before the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains, Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., disputed claims that U.S. grain companies have made huge profits from certificate trading. "The certs program is not in any way a windfall to the trade," he said. Johnson said that Cargill has been dealing with a two pct spread in certificate transactions, and that this is within the normal grain marketing levels. Johnson recognized current concern over the cost of certificates as compared to cash, but said that critics need to look more closely at the savings caused by certs, noting for example that widespread use of certs in the PIK and Roll marketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs. Certificates are also an important part of any export promotion program, he said. "The more you look at ways to expand export markets, the more you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more grain into the market to meet demand," he said. Subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman (D-Kans.) said his committee would be looking at the certificate program later this year and studying the General Accounting Office report on certificate costs.  
PACIFIC RESOURCES &lt;PRI> INSTALLS OIL MOORING Pacific Resources Inc said it has installed a CALM (Catenary Anchor Leg Mooring) single-point mooring terminal off the southwest coast of Oahu at its Hawaiian Independent Refinery at a cost of 3.5 mln dlrs. The system transfers crude and fuel oils from tankers to the refinery's tank farm and carries refined products to ships for export, PRI said. Company chairman Robert G. Reed said the new mooring system will permit 24-hour service in most kinds of weather and will reduce ship turnaround time. He said the mooring is the first of its kind in the U.S. The new system can accomodate vessels up to 150,000 deadweight tons, or one mln barrels of cargo, PRI said.

Taunton, which went public last June, said the rate was based on 3,220,000 outstanding shares. It said the dividend was payable April 15 to shareholders of record March 31. The company said it did not know if it would pay regular dividends in the future.  
UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS The "cross field allowance" relief on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co. The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval. A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly benefit in PRT saving on an existing field. "The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no PRT liability," the report said, adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced. The government would in effect be subsidising these developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax, the report said. On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said. In a study on probable fields, the report said that when the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9 pct. The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will be lost. Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later time.  
MIYAZAWA SEES BIG NATIONS REAFFIRMING PARIS PACT Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a parliamentary committee he expects major nations to reafffirm the currency pact they struck in Paris when they meet this week in Washington, political sources said.

In Paris on February 22, six nations - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - pledged to cooperate to hold their currencies stable.

VOLCKER SEES TIGHT POLICY HURTING INVESTMENT Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said a restrictive monetary policy would be damaging to investment and that a better course would be to restrain spending. "A restrictive monetary policy would hit investment. You don't want to put interest rates up unless you have to," Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee. "That is not a constructive way to proceed," he said. Volcker said that given a choice between squeezing the budget deficit or squeezing investment, he would favor squeezing the budget deficit. In response to a question about banks, Volcker said he would be pleased if Congress decided to give banks a tax writeoff as an incentive for them to take greater reserves against loans to debtor countries. "If you give a tax writeoff for reserving against loans, then we will see more reserving and that would make me happy," Volcker told Committee Chairman Sen William Proxmire (D-Wisc).  
SWEDEN TO GO AHEAD WITH S. AFRICAN TRADE SANCTIONS Sweden's ruling Social Democratic Party gave full power to the government to decree unilateral trade sanctions against South Africa, Prime Minister Ingvar Calrsson said. Carlsson told a news conference the party decided the fight against apartheid took priority over Sweden's traditional policy of only adopting sanctions with the backing of the U.N. Security Council. The government will decide later what form the trade boycott will take and when it will come into force.  
PARIS G-6 MEET SET NO TARGETS - LEIGH-PEMBERTON Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton said the Paris pact agreed between six leading industrialised nations set no nominal exchange rate targets. Leigh-Pemberton said in oral evidence to a select committee that "we did not swap numbers - we reached an understanding" on how to cooperate towards stabilizing currencies at around their current levels. He said the accord had brought Britain into a form of joint currency float - but one which let it still purse an independent monetary policy. "I would concede that, since the Louvre Accord, we are acting as if we are in something," Leigh-Pemberton said. "The Louvre and Plaza accords show there is a very effective role for the (Group of) seven central banks to operate together" towards stabilising exchange rates," Leigh-Pemberton said. He did not mention this week's intervention by central banks to support the dollar, after markets decided to test the accord. Leigh-Pemberton said that "the effectiveness of this (cooperation) is actually larger than many of us had thought in the pre-Plaza days" before September 1985. He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that "we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing." He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that "we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing." Leigh-Pemberton said that, in principle, the Bank of England favoured full EMS membership for sterling, provided such a move did not endanger U.K. Anti-inflation monetary policy. Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rates lower, he said "the two half point cuts (this month in banks' base lending rates) have been appropriate up until now." Leigh-Pemberton said he preferred a "cautious step-by-step approach" to reducing short term interest rates, not least because "we have a potential problem with inflation." Underlying U.K. Inflation was currently around 4.0 pct, "one of the highest" among industrialised nations, he added. Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank of England had not wanted base rates to fall before the unveiling of the 1987/88 budget on March 17, but he said pressure from financial markets for such a move had proved irresistible. Base rates are now at 10 pct. Regarding sterling's relationship with oil, Leigh-Pemberton said that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall. He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrel might suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England's sterling index, when compared with the index's level before oil prices dropped from around the 30 dlr level. The index, base 1975, closed here today at 72.1, unchanged from the previous close.  
GROUP SELLS STAKE IN COMDATA NETWORK &lt;CDN> A group of investment firms which had once sought control of Comdata Network Inc, told the Securities and Exchange Commission it sold its remaining 1,113,500-share, or 5.9 pct, stake in the company. The group, which had owned as much as 9.5 pct of the total, said it sold the stake on March 27 at 15-3/4 dlrs a share. Last week it sold 455,000 Comdata shares. Group members are CNI Partners, an investment partnership, Mason Best Co, a Texas investment partnership, and Houston Imperial Corp, a real estate development firm.  
NUMEROUS FACTORS SAID POINT TO USSR CORN BUYING A greater than anticipated need, competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking Soviet interest in U.S. corn, industry and government officials said. As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the Soviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factors that make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely. First, there are supply concerns. Some trade sources said recent speculation has been that last year's Soviet grain crop be revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mln announced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain. A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect Soviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said. Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the USSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its Argentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln tonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were also cut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes. Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this year's corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mln tonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR. "Significant downside potential" still exists for the Argentine crop, the official said, which will decrease the amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow. "If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking, then they might need more than what Argentina can provide during the April to June period," he said. Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparked Soviet buying. U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine corn for 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Soviet sources said. "This price difference makes American corn competitive," Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union, told Reuters. Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause those prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. corn futures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices have bottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said. Finally, some industry sources said that by buying the minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grains agreement (four mln tonnes), the Soviet Union may be hoping to convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat. In an inteview with Reuters this week, USDA secretary Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat subsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out.

Clark Equipment also said the investor group agreed to enter into a standstill agreement which prohibits members of the group from purchasing shares of voting securities of Clark for 10 years.  
AUSTRALIA SAID TO RELY TOO MUCH ON OIL TAXES The government's over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting Australia's economic performance, Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said. Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income is derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak crude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here. This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the country's economic performance directly by acting as a disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting trading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said. Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency position is posing a major economic threat, yet the government's response has been to load new tax burdens on the oil industry, Benbow said. Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to fall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from 546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the Bass Strait fields, he said. Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the three largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said. By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over half the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from existing fields goes ahead, Benbow said. Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said. Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to 680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years time, he said. At present world oil prices and the current value of the Australian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said. Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, the addition to reserves has been inadequate, he said. For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five years 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said. He called on the government to review its tax policies to restore incentive to exploration.

KEYCORP &lt;KEY> AGREES TO ACQUIRE UTAH BANK Keycorp said it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Commercial Security Bancorp &lt;CSEC> by exchanging Keycorp common valued at 63 dlrs for each Commercial Securities share. Keycorp said this gives the transaction an indicated value of 102 mln dlrs. Keycorp said the amount of its stock to be exchanged will be based on the daily average closing price of the shares for an unspecified period prior to the closing of the acquisition. Based on a maximum of about 2.75 Keycorp shares and a minimum of about 1.8 Keycorp to be exchanged, the agreement provides that if the average price of Keycorp common is less than 21.50 dlrs a share during the pricing period, the agreement will terminate unless a new conversion ratio can be negotiated. Keycorp said the transaction is designed to be tax free to Commercial Security shareholders. The company said it will treat the merger as a pooling of interests. It said the proposal is subject to approval by Commercial Security shareholders and various regulators. Keycorp said the merger is expected to become effective as soon as possible after December 31, 1987, the date Utah's interstate banking law becomes operational. Keycorp said Richard K. Hemingway and certain members of the Hemingway family who own about 30 pct of Commercial Security's outstanding shares have agreed to vote in favor of the transaction and not dispose of their stock. Based in Salt Lake City, Commercial Security ended 1986 with assets of 830.3 mln dlrs, net loans of 496.6 mln dlrs and deposits of 707.9 mln dlrs. It had net income of 5.1 mln dlrs or 3.16 dlrs a share on 1.6 mln average shares outstanding last year.  
RENEWED BULL SPREADING LIKELY ON CATTLE REPORT Livestock analysts expect renewed bull spreading in live cattle futures following yesterday's USDA 7-state cattle on feed report. The USDA reported high placements in February, which may weigh on back months of cattle futures. Meanwhile, continued strong marketings during the month will support the April contract. Contracts for June delivery forward could open 25 to 50 cents lower while April will likely open about steady, analysts said. Cheap corn is still the main incentive for putting cattle on feed, according to Smith Barney livestock analyst Tom O'Hare. "They have no place to send the grain," he said. Strong daily fundamentals may add to nearby support while the current discount of deferred months to the cash market may offset much of the effect of the report, analysts said. "The cash market is strong and may overshadow the report," said Robin Fuller, analyst for Agri Analysis. She added that even though placements came in above the average trade guess, many traders had expected high placements. Placements are not that negative, especially since the technical correction in June and August live cattle futures since last week, GH Miller analyst Jerry Gidel said. He said the current marketing posture will provide added support to the nearby month. Feedlot marketings have been running at a heavier than expected pace. Chuck Levitt, analyst for Shearson Lehman said that with the number of cattle on feed down five pct at the beginning of the year, a three pct decline in marketings was expected. But the report for January showed marketings at 101 pct of a year ago and in February marketings were at 100 pct, Levitt noted. "So far we haven't seen any decline in marketings. They (feedlot operators) are marketing more cattle than they had intended for the first quarter, which is a bullish development," Levitt said. Gidel also noted that marketings for the early part of March are running ahead of a year ago. Feedlots are not falling behind and are holding that 100 pct marketing pace.  
FED SEEN CONTENT WITH U.S. FEBRUARY ECONOMY U.S. February reports reflecting slim gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said. "If you're the Fed, there's no reason to do anything," said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc. "There are hints that GNP is picking up. On the inflation front, all is well," he said. "Money supply is well under control. It's an absolutely ideal situation." February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly less than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected. This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's production number, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase. The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct, less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct rise in the PPI in January. "The Fed is going to look at this positively," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation. "Certainly inflation is not as bad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants." The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in February, after a 9.8 pct increase in January. "This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per barrel," said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "The trend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year." In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct decline in the PPI. Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected, but a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices fell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both the financial markets and the Federal Reserve. "The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today," said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International. While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier monetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar. "The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air," he said. "We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with foreign producers." Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct in February's PPI. With many electronic goods produced overseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said. If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish overseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices. By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987. Slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire, and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar. David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S. industrial output. "It's the other side of the lower dollar," Wyss said. "Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output." Wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter. "It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive." But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output. Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in February business equipment production. Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2 pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced, not that manufacturing activity gained. Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5 million units. "In the first quarter, it looks like automakers are producing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling at roughly a seven mln unit rate," Roach said. "The disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventories." Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of 1987. January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain since July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the Commerce Department said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, the largest monthly sales drop on record. Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react to month-to-month changes. "The Fed has been standing pat for the last seven months," Ramirez said. "They will continue to stand pat for at least the next couple of months."

COST OF PIK CERTIFICATES TO BE EYED BY CONGRESS Congress, eager to find budget savings, launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department's generic commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDA and the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over how much the program has cost U.S. taxpayers. The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who asked not to be identified said. USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, saying it did not take into account storage, handling and transport savings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided to re-examine the costs, sources said. The issue is an important one, because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as a means of cutting spending. Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow. Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp, CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said. USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage. It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigative arm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs, Reagan administration sources said. The GAO is expected to point out that use of payment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold. The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of PIK certificates. The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, or certs, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or cash. Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion dlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another 6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and August 1987, according to USDA. Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate. Eliminating this practice, called "PIK and roll," would save the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according to a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments. The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other savings alternatives. The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one administration official said. However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on USDA criticism, department officials said. The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year. USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has found that between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel. Between September and November, however, certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS study, obtained by Reuters.  
AMERICAN PORK CONGRESS TO BE OVERHAULED IN 1988 The National Pork Producers Council, NPPC, announced at this year's American Pork Congress, APC, that the Congress and trade show will be divided into two parts in 1988. Next years APC, held in Atlanta, will be a business session only and will continue to be the first week of March. The trade show is being changed into a new international event called the World Pork Expo. The first expo will be held in June 1988 in Des Moines with an expanded format, they said. Executive vice-president Orville Sweet said the decision to spilt the show and Congress came about because there are producers who never get to see the trade show floor. "It makes sense that we divide the business session from the trade show," Sweet said.

U.S. HOUSE TARGETING PROPOSAL SPARKS INTEREST A proposal by two U.S. House Democrats to target government farm benefits to small- and medium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on a House subcommittee today. "On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen," said Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. "This is the first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative to the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal." The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and Byron Dorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs per bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receive deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not more than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat. The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20 pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits. Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five years, protect family farms and eliminate government accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be halted. However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would "involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a family farmer is." Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict program payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas. Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and therefore eligible for payments.  
CALTEX TO RAISE BAHRAIN OIL PRODUCT PRICES Caltex Petroleum Corp said it will raise posted prices for naphtha and several grades of residual fuel in Bahrain, effective March 25. Caltex, a joint venture of Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> and Texaco INC &lt;TX>, said its naphtha posting is up four cts a gallon to 43 cts. It said it is raising its marine diesel oil posting by 30 cts a barrel to 20.24 dlrs a barrel. Light, medium, and heavy fuel oil postings are up 1.50 dlrs a barrel, the company said. This will bring the light fuel oil price to 16.90 dlrs, medium to 15.50 dlrs, and heavy to 14.60 dlrs, the company said.

MIXED ASIAN REACTION TO NEW RUBBER PACT Governments of major Asian producing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), but growers and traders are unhappy with the development, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. Officials in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, which produce the bulk of the world's rubber, said they expected the new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber industries remain viable in the long-term. But traders and growers said they were against the new pact because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises. The new INRA, to replace the current one which expires on October 22, was formally adopted by most of the world's producers and consumers in Geneva last Friday. It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of liquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber and a possible depression of prices. He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose or fell through its buffer stock system. Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done through direct cash contributions from members, he said. Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to finance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become indebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International Tin Agreement. "This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out without any financial encumbrance," Lim said. Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking cabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers and consumers would also become members, he said. Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit to Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices. It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because its new financial provisions had been tightened, they said. Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market operations. Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at levels that were only acceptable to consumers. "With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable level, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price, while producers may never see sharp price rises," a Malaysian Rubber Producers Council source told Reuters. Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the overhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had psychologically prevented price rises, he said. State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had been depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a buffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise. Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was expensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added. Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers to produce more. Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to allow sharp price fluctuations in future. "The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be liquidated and a free market returned," a Malaysian trader said. Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success as most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they questioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers to finance buffer stock operations.  
GERMAN FEBRUARY CENTRAL BANK MONEY GROWTH STEADY West German central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5 pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct reported in January, provisional data from the Bundesbank showed. The figure was thus outside the three to six pct range set by the Bundesbank for 1987. In absolute terms, the measure rose to 223.2 billion marks in February from 221.8 billion in the prior month. The data showed that the stock grew at an annualized 8.6 pct over the six months to February, slower than the 9.4 pct rise in the same period to January. Of the two components comprising central bank money stock, cash in circulation rose to 111.7 billion marks in February from 110.9 billion in January, the Bundesbank data showed. This gave an annualized 8.3 pct rise over the six months to February, down from a 10.2 pct increase over the six months to January. Minimum reserve requirements on domestic liabilities grew to 111.5 billion marks in February from 110.9 billion in January. This yielded an annualized 8.8 pct rise over the six month to February, up slightly from an 8.6 pct increase over the same period to January.

GUARDIAN TRUSTCO SEES MODEST 1987 OUTLOOK &lt;Guardian Trustco Inc>, earlier reporting a 198 pct increase in full year earnings per share, said the outlook for 1987 is more modest. The company said it has started a number of long-term growth projects which have a payback period exceeding one year. Guardian Trustco did not give a specific earnings forecast. The company earlier reported 1986 net profit rose to 2,853,000 dlrs or 1.25 dlrs a share, from year-earlier 1,579,000 dlrs or 42 cts a share.  
CHRYSLER &lt;C> AMC BUYOUT VALUED AT 1.55 BILLION Chrysler Corp's proposed acquisition of American Motors Corp is valued at about 1.55 billion dlrs, including the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs in American Motor' debt that Chrysler will assume, analysts said. They said Chrysler's cost of acquisition was valued at  782 mln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares. The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefing Chrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his company's agreement with Renault to assume AMC's debt as well as 332 mln dlrs in unfunded pension liabilities, though the latter is not included valuing the transaction. Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler's proposed purchase of its much-smaller rival, but said they expected the transaction would carry with it a short-term dilution in Chrysler's earnings. A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, told Reuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it would have been had a deal been struck last year because the impact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler's ability to assume AMC's large reserve of tax-loss carryforwards accumulated from its losses since 1980. "There were very serious discussions last fall but we didn't pull it off," the source said in a reference to the assassination in November of former Renault chairman Georges Besse. "It's too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor. And Renault could have gotten a much better price if we'd done it before the end of last year." In addition to AMC's debt and its pension liabilities, the source said Chrysler would also assume any liability from lawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called "an overhang to the company." Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them that the deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principal in the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest, 35 mln dlrs cash for Renault's equity in AMC's finance subsidiary, 25 mln dlrs in cash for "transaction fees" in connection with the acquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paid AMC shareholders. "The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption," analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters. Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12 billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal. But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMC's liabilities, his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMC debt that is being carried at "non-market" rates. He said there were difficulties in negotiating with the previous Renault management on the acquisition because they were committed to the group's business plan of which AMC was an integral part. "The new management didn't have that problem - AMC wasn't their baby," he said.

GENCORP &lt;GY> REJECTS UNSOLICITED TAKEOVER BID Gencorp Inc said its board urged shareholders to reject the hostile unsolicited 100 dlr a share tender offer made March 18 by General Acquisition Inc, an affiliate of Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries INc. Gencorp also said it is developing a financially superior alternative that would enable shareholders to benefit from the full value of the company. In a letter to shareholders, Chairman A. William Reynolds said the offer is a "highly conditional, contingently financed bust-up offer" that seeks to deny shareholders the true value of their investment in Gencorp. Reynolds said the board reached its decision to reject the offer after careful study with legal and financial advisers. He said the board has authorized management to explore alternatives aimed at providing shareholders with a "financially superior" alternative to the general acquisition offer. A Gencorp spokesman, in response to questions, would not comment on market speculation that the company's management may develop a leveraged buyout offer of its own. He would also not comment on when a better alternative might be developed. Gencorp's stock has traded well above the 100 dlr offer price since the tender was made. Today, Gencorp closed at 114-1/4, up 1-5/8. Reynolds said in the letter that for the last few years, Gencorp management has taken action to enhance shareholder value, and the stock price and earnings have improved since he joined the company. Gencorp said the partnership's offer is a "bargain price" acquisition that was "using financing from a syndicate of banks that does not yet exist and a bridge loan from Shearson Lehman brothers that shearson is not obligated to provide." Reynolds also said the offer would result in a radical alteration and selloff of Gencorp's assets, including Aerojet General to refinance General Acquisition's borrowings with the profits going to Wagner and Brown and AFG instead of shareholders. The letter also said the General Acquisition offer "jeopardizes the security and interests" of its shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and the communities throughout the country where the company's facilities are located.  
U.S. PRODUCER ENERGY PRICES RISE IN FEBRUARY Prices of wholesale finished energy goods in the United States were up in February, rising by 4.0 pct after a 9.8 pct rise in January, the Labor Department said.

BAKER SAYS G-6 PACT JUST A START Treasury Secretary James Baker said the agreement among industrial nations in Paris last month is only a start in Washington's drive to intensify economic cooperation among leading countries. In a speech to the National Newspaper Association, Baker said "the six steps beginning with the Plaza Agreement and culminating in the Paris Accord, are only a start." He added "we see our role as a steward of a process in which we sit down with our industrial allies to find ways to promote more balanced international growth." The Paris agreements called trade surplus countries to strengthen their growth and on the U.S. to reduce its budget deficit. Under such circumstances, the countries agreed their currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals. Baker also said he still sees "ominous" signs of pressure for protectionist trade legislation "and this pressure for protectionism is coming from new areas of society." But he also said he believed a coalition was forming that supported free trade.

UK MINISTER LOOKS TO EASE TENSION WITH JAPAN The U.K. government hopes for a breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies during next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard, political sources said. Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, told Reuters he will try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit. Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in solving the row over a U.K. firm's bid to win a significant role in Japan's telecommunications market, government sources said. Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to arm itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be used against certain Japanese financial institutions. Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc, government officials said. But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo that Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more than politeness in the face of British anger, they added.

CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK LOWERING VISA RATES &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> said it was lowering the interest rate on its Visa credit card to 15.9 pct from 18.6 pct, effective with the May billing statement. The bank said it was also halving its yearly Visa card user fee to six dlrs, but would retain its 15 ct fee for each transaction. A bank spokesman said the previously reported call by the Canadian Parliament's finance committee on March 20 for a substantial cut in credit card rates "was a factor" in the move, but he would not elaborate. Canada's minister of state for finance Thomas Hockin had threatened legislation to reduce the rates, which apply to unpaid balances, if the financial institutions did not voluntarily act. The Canadian Imperial Bank spokesman said "the bank card market is a very competitive one and we have to move to stay competitive." Canadian Imperial's new rates match those of &lt;Toronto Dominion Bank>, which lowered its rates before the finance committee report. Canadian Imperial Bank added that cardholders will be allowed to choose between the 15 ct transaction fee or the six dlr yearly card fee. It will also eliminate the 50 ct minimum monthly transaction fee, it said. Minister of State for Finance, Tom Hockin, said in the House of Commons today he was "delighted" with the bank's cut in its credit card rate. "I would hope retail stores and other financial institutions will look to their rates as well," Hockin said during the daily question period.

INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). "The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. But countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.

CHINA FOREIGN RESERVES EXCEED 10 BILLION DLRS China's foreign exchange reserves are more than 10 billion dlrs, enough to cover import payments for three to four months, Vice Premier Tian Jiyun said. He told a news conference that China also has considerable reserves of gold. He gave no figure. The last published figure for foreign exchange reserves was 10.37 billion dlrs at end-September 1986, down from 10.47 billion at end-June and 12.59 billion at end-September 1985.  
ALCAN, BERTONE MAKE ALUMINUM STRUCTURE CAR Alcan Aluminium Ltd said it joined with Carrozzeria Bertone S.P.A. to exhibit Alcan's technology in aluminum structured vehicles at Geneva's international auto salon. Alcan said it and Bertone have built several Bertone X1/9 sports cars with structures of adhesively bonded sheet aluminum. It said the bodies were made on presses used for Bertone's steel-structured sports cars. Alcan said two of the cars are currently being tested in Britain by the Motor Industry Research Association. Alcan said it has developed and tested the aluminum structure technology so that it is suitable for modern auto making methods and plants. Alcan said the technology, which reduces the weight of a car's basic structure by up to 50 pct, can improve handling and performance and reduce fuel consumption for any size car. It said the structures also provide long life without the need for rust protection. The structure provides the same stiffness and safety as present materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65 pct reduction in spot welds, Alcan said.  
TWO BRAZILIAN SHIPPING FIRMS SETTLE WITH STRIKERS Two small shipping companies have reached a pay deal with striking seamen, but union leaders said most of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still on strike. A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro said the seamen had accepted a 120 pct pay offer from the companies, Globo and Flumar, which have less than 200 employees each. The two-week strike comes as Brazil faces a debt crisis and is delaying exports badly needed to earn foreign exchange. Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto said the government will not force a settlement of the strike, which was ruled illegal last Friday.

U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN The U.S. is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt strategy, a Reagan administration official said. The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms. In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a "megabank," where Third World debt would be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the same time, however, the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground. The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine suggestions that "exit bonds" be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan, the official said in an interview with Reuters. "All of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered," said the official, who asked not to be named. In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations. In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth. "The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors have been performing well," said the official. But he admitted that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an exception. The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S. Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker, also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis. "We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively," the official said. Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that commercial banks create a "megabank" which could swap Third World debt paper for so-called "exit bonds" for banks like regional American or European institutions. Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs. He emphasised that the "megabank" was not an administration plan but "something some people have suggested." Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would differ slightly from the one the official described. But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United States. "If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go, fine. I don't think they ever will." He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution. Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than 5/8 pct above Libor. "The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite unique and I don't think it's something that should be categorically rejected out of hand," the official said. Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes. These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point over Libor. Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt. But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the banks. "It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before," the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek. "Some people argue that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really is is narrowing the spread on new money," he added. He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the Philippines'.  
NORTHGATE &lt;NGX> QUEBEC ORE RESERVES DECLINE Northgate Exploration Ltd said year-end 1986 ore reserves at its two Chibougamau mines in Quebec fell to 8,141,150 short tons grading 0.077 ounce gold a ton and 1.63 pct copper from year-earlier 8,462,000 tons grading 0.077 ounce gold ton and 1.67 pct copper. The company said it launched a 700,000 dlr exploration program at the mines to increase production and ensure the operations' continued long life. Ore production totaled 650,653 tons last year, it said, estimating year-end reserves contained about 627,000 ounces of gold and 265 mln pounds of copper.

JACOBS SUCHARD SEES 100,000 TONNE COCOA SURPLUS Jacobs Suchard AG expects a world cocoa surplus of around 100,000 tonnes in 1987 compared with a 104,000 tonne surplus in 1986, Jens Sroka, head of commodity buying, told a news conference. The company expects prices to remain at around current levels despite the likelihood of agreement on buffer stock rules at the forthcoming London cocoa talks, and believes market intervention by the buffer stock manager would stabilise prices. Sroka said world coffee prices are expected to remain weak if any international coffee talks fail to produce agreement. Sroka said stagnating consumption and slight overproduction will continue to weigh on coffee prices and he forecast a continued build-up in stocks. The recent failure of the London coffee talks had surprised market observers. Unless reason prevails and the major producers return to the conference table, the world coffee market will remain free and the consequences for some producers dependant on coffee for their foreign exchange earnings would be catastrophic, Sroka added.

It said initial projections were for a 4.6 pct increase in gdp this year. The sectors which registered the greatest growth in 1986 were fisheries with 10 pct, agriculture at 8.7 pct, transport and communications with 8.1 pct and industry at 8.0 pct, the bank added.  
COMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELP RETURN TO PROFITS Comalco Ltd said its return to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture. It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final dividend, delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985. Comalco said the aluminium industry continues to suffer from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings. Comalco's Commonwealth Aluminium Corp unit said earlier it has conditionally agreed to sell its Goldendale smelter in Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to Columbia Aluminium Corp. Comalco said its extraordinary provision of 27.3 mln dlrs costs for Goldendale losses and closure may be reduced if the sales agreement were completed.  
HARPER &lt;HPR> GETS BID FROM HARCOURT &lt;HBJ> Harper and Row Publishers Inc said it received an acquisition offer from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich INc to acquire all of Harper and Row's shares at 50 dlrs a share in cash. Harper said it will consider the proposal, including such possible concerns as anti-trust and other legal considerations. On Monday, Harper and Row received a surprise 34 dlr-a- share bid from investor Theodore Cross, owner of six pct of the shares, for the stock he does not own. Harcourt made clear in its offer that it will step aside if Harper's directors and shareholders reject the bid, Harper said. Harper said the board has previously expressed a strong determination to remain an independent publishing enterprise. Harper also said that New World Pictures, a shareholder, has requested a copy of Harper's shareholder list to be used in soliciting proxies. New World has 30,800 shares of the total 4.4 mln shares. Harper and Row's stock closed off 3/4 to 33-1/2 after rising 9-1/4 points yesterday. Shareholders are due to vote April 2 on a shareholders rights plan designed to thwart hostile takeovers. Ivan Obolensky, an analyst with the investment banking for of Sterling Grace and Co said Harper and Row is one of the few remaining independent publishers with a "back list" of authors stretching back 200 years. He said as long as the company maintains copyrights with the estates of deceased authors, it controls all motion picture and television rights to the stories. And he said new printing technologies make new editions a profitable business. "Harcourt Brace needs a back list of that nature and is willing to pay up for it," Obolensky said. But he said Harper and Row "has plenty of beef to warrant a 50 dlr bid.

BALDRIGE SUPPORTS NIC TALKS ON CURRENCIES Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he supported efforts to persuade newly-industrialized countries (NICS) to revalue currencies that are tied to the dollar in order to help the United States cut its massive trade deficit. "We do need to do something with those currencies or we will be substituting Japanese products for Taiwanese products," or those of other nations with currencies tied to the dollar, Baldrige told a House banking subcommittee. The U.S. dollar has declined in value against the Yen and European currencies, but has changed very little against the currencies of some developing countries such as South Korea and Taiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar. As a result, efforts to reduce the value of the dollar over the past year and a half have done little to improve the trade deficits with those countries. Baldrige told a House Banking subcommittee that the Treasury Department was attempting to persuade those countries to reach agreement with the United States on exchange rates.

WORLD BANK TO BRING BORROWING FORWARD THIS YEAR The World Bank intends to bring borrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because it expects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bank vice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said. He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan, West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. "The weight of opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higher probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower interest rates," he said. The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so far this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates. The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at a level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where and how much to borrow, Rotberg said. Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years' anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding debt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years. Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, it did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the sake of innovation, Rotberg said. Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only some eight billion had been swapped into another currency. Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or unfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident that this was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments. The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over the next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However, for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new instruments such as bonds with warrants. The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germany since the first issue was launched in 1959, he said.

BHP SEES STRONG FOURTH QUARTER BUT LOWER YEAR NET The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> said it expects a strong full year result, helped by sigificant investment allowance credits in the fourth quarter, but net will fall short of the record 988.2 mln dlrs earned in 1985/86 ended May 31. The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to 603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28 from 813.0 mln a year earlier. Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November 31, BHP said in a statement. Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of share analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs. BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents after declaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a one-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1. The bonus is being made from reserves which will not qualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction of dividend imputation next July 1. The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHP said. BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of dividend will be maintained on the increased capital. The level of future dividends will be influenced by the implications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation, it said. As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free in shareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits that have borne the full 49 pct company tax rate. BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, said petroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mln a year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln. BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected generally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait while the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic sales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new plant and some operational difficulties. The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrs from 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in ownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said. The 60.7 mln dlr extraordinary gain, all in the third term, reflected a 240.7 mln profit on the sale of &lt;Blue Circle Southern Cement Ltd> offset by a U.S. Oil acreage writedown.

TRADE BILL TO CHANGE AGRICULTURE TRADE LAWS The House Ways and Means Committee is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws. The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign unfair trade practices against other domestic industries. The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge. The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be approved. In investigations involving a processed agricultural product, trade associations of processors or producers would have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair duties. The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture, seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and non-tariff barriers. President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATT agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended through January 3, 1991. The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate an international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989. It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur before Octoer 1, 1991. Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be processed within three years after import and exported within five years. Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from imports.  
U.S. GRAIN ANALYSTS SEE LOWER CORN, SOY PLANTING Grain analysts surveyed by the American Soybean Association, ASA, projected acreage this year at 59.1 mln acres of soybeans and 64.7 mln acres of corn. In 1986, farmers planted 61.5 mln acres of soybeans and 76.7 mln acres of corn, according to the February 9 USDA supply/demand report. The USDA is to release its 1987 planting intentions report March 31. The survey included 15 soybean estimates and 13 corn estimates and was released in the March 16 Soybean Update newsletter sent to members. Estimates ranged from 56.0 mln to 63.0 mln acres of soybeans and 59.5 mln to 68.0 mln acres of corn. An ASA spokesman said the association plans no survey of farmers' planting intentions this year.  
BLACK MINERS SUPPORT S. AFRICAN MINES TAKEOVER Thousands of black mineworkers roared support for a union proposal to seize control of South Africa's gold, uranium, platinum and coal mines if the owners refuse to improve conditions for migrant black workers. About 15,000 miners attended a rally here to endorse moves proposed by last week's annual meeting of the 200,000 strong National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). They also supported a proposal for a national strike at the end of this month if the owners refused to begin negotiations. Migrant workers from surrounding countries make up more than half of the labour force in the mines. It was not stated how the union would "seize control." The miners' leaders also demanded an end to the system of single sex hostels for migrant workers, to be replaced by housing schemes so that workers could live with their families. The crowd, one of the largest to attend a meeting since South Africa declared a state of emergency last June, also shouted approval of a proposal to work closely with anti-apartheid movements such as the United Democratic Front (UDF) which claims two mln members. They also shouted their support for a demand that jailed black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela be released.

IVORY COAST MINISTER DELAYED FOR COCOA TALKS Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) council, will not be able to open the council session here tomorrow, an Ivorian ICCO delegate told Reuters. He will arrive sometime later during the meetings here, the delegate said. The council session will be chaired instead by ICCO vice chairman Sir Denis Henry, the delegate from Grenada, ICCO officials said. Ivorian officials last week said Bra Kanon was due to return home for funeral ceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny March 19-22.  
SAN DIEGO GAS &lt;SDO> SEES DECISION HURTING NET San Diego Gas and Electric Co said a California Public Utilities Commission decision to reconsider allowing only 20 mln dlrs of the 69 mln dlrs in San Onofre nuclear station costs it disallowed makes it likely that earnings in 1987 will be reduced at least 36 cts per share. The company said if the decision to disallow the other 20 mln dlrs is not changed, earnings would be penalized by another 19 cts.  
COURT REJECTS BUITONI APPEAL OVER IRI FOOD UNIT An appeal by Buitoni SpA against a court ruling that an accord under which it was to acquire Italian state food firm SME - Societa Meridionale Finanziaria was not contractually binding has been rejected, court officials said. An appeal court rejected Buitoni's claim that the 497 billion lire accord with the state industrial company IRI - Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale was a binding contract. The decision upholds a court ruling of last July. Buitoni is controlled by CIR - Compagnie Industriali Riunite, an investment company itself controlled by Ing C Olivetti EC SpA (OLIV.MI> chairman Carlo De Benedetti.  
U.S. SENATE PANEL MAKES CONSERVATION EXEMPTION The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee approved a measure that would exempt farmers who planted alfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between 1981 and 1985 from a federal conservation requirement. Sen. Edward Zorinsky, D-Neb., said his bill would restore equity under federal sodbuster rules, which currently deny farm program benefits to farmers who, between 1981 and 1985, planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes without interrupting the plantings with a row crop. An official from a leading conservation group, who asked not to be identified, said the panel's move was "an unfortunate first action" because it could lead to the exemption of potentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations, established under the 1985 farm bill.  
MERRILL LYNCH &lt;MER> FIRES VASKEVITCH Merrill Lynch and Co Inc fired the head of the mergers department in its London office today, saying he had been unable to provide a "satisfactory explanation" in response to insider trading charges filed yesterday by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Merrill Lynch's statement at midday today said the firm will continue to cooperatie fully with authoriteis in the U.S. and London investigating Vaskevitch's activities.  
CALNY &lt;CLNY> GETS BID FROM PEPSICO &lt;PEP> Calny Inc said it has received an offer to be acquired by PepsiCo Inc, which already owns 9.9 pct of Calny stock, for 11.50 dlrs per share, subject to approval by PepsiCo and Calny boards and Calny shareholders. The company said its board intendsd to schedule a meeting in the near future to review the proposal and it has asked &lt;Oppenheimer and Co Inc> to assist it in evaluating the offer and advise Calny on its alternatives. Calny is the largest franchisee of PepsiCo's Taco Bell restaurants, operating 143 in California, Oregon, Texas and Washington as well as 15 La Petite Boulangerie bakeries in Seattle. Calny earned 1,192,000 dlrs on sales of 56.2 mln dlrs for the nine months ended November Four. On December Four, Calny rejected as inadequate an investor group led by former president and chairman Robert A. Larive's second offer to acquire it because the bid was inadeuqate and subject to too many contingencies.  The group offered 11.50 dlrs and one dlr of 10 pct preferred stock per Calny share.  
FEDERATED DEPARTMENT &lt;FDS> RAISES QTLY DIVIDEND Federated Department Stores Inc said it raised its quarterly common stock dividend to 74 cts a share, from 67 cts, an increase of 10.5 pct.

At the same time, Federated said it will ask shareholders to approve an increase in the number of authorized shares to 400 mln, from 200 mln. Federated said the dividend is payable on a pre-split basis on April 24 to shareholders of record April 10. New shares from the stock split will be distributed May 11, it said.

CCC ACCEPTS EXPORT BONUS BID ON BARLEY TO ISRAEL The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover the sale of 30,000 long tons of barley to Israel, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The department said the barley is for delivery April 15/May 15 and the bonus awarded was 41.24 dlrs per ton. The bonus was made to Cargill, Inc and will be paid in the form of commodities from CCC stocks. An additional 133,800 tons of U.S. barley are still available to Israel under the Export Enhancement Program announced June 17, 1986, it said.  
U.S. TREASURY SAYS NO COMMENT ON YEN VALUE A Treasury Department spokesman refused comment on statements by Robert Ortner, undersecretary of economic affairs for the Commerce Department, that the Japanese yen was undervalued. Ortner, senior economist at the Commerce Department, told an Export-Import Bank conference "the yen is still a little bit undervalued," and "could go up another 10 or 15 pct." Asked for reaction, a Treasury spokesman said officials were aware of Ortner's comments but had no intention of making any comment on them. Ortner, who stressed he was expressing personal views, said he thought the U.S. dollar was "fairly priced" against most European currencies and added "I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen," he said. But the yen should go up 10 or 15 pct in value, Ortner said, because it is undervalued against the dollar. The United States and major trade allies West Germany, France, Britain, Japan and Canada met recently in Paris to discuss maintaining stability in international currency values.

U.K. WHEAT AND BARLEY EXPORTS ADJUSTED UPWARDS The U.K. Exported 535,460 tonnes of wheat and 336,750 tonnes of barley in January, the Home Grown Cereals Authority (HGCA) said, quoting adjusted Customs and Excise figures. Based on the previous January figures issued on February 9, wheat exports increased by nearly 64,000 tonnes and barley by about 7,000 tonnes. The new figures bring cumulative wheat exports for the period July 1/February 13 to 2.99 mln tonnes, and barley to 2.96 mln compared with 1.25 and 1.89 mln tonnes respectively a year ago. January wheat exports comprised 251,000 tonnes to European Community destinations and 284,000 tonnes to third countries. The Soviet Union was prominent in third country destinations, taking 167,700 tonnes while Poland was credited with 54,500 and South Korea 50,000 tonnes. Italy was the largest EC recipient with 75,000 tonnes followed by West Germany with 55,200 and France 52,000 tonnes. Barley exports for January comprised 103,700 tonnes to the EC and 233,000 to third countries. The Soviet Union was the largest single importer with 133,265 tonnes followed by Saudi Arabia with 53,800 tonnes.

FIRST INTERSTATE &lt;I> ESTIMATES LOSS ON BRAZIL First Interstate Bancorp Chairman Joseph Pinola said the bank holding company would lose about 16 mln dlrs per year, after taxes, if it had to put its medium and long-term debt on non-accrual status. In an interview, he said that could result in about a 4.5 pct decline in annual earnings per share. Pinola said First Interstate, like other banks, has not yet decided to put the loans, which Brazil stopped paying interest on last month, on non-accrual status. "None of us really wants to injure negotiations that might be going on," he said. First Interstate reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission last week that it has about 339 mln dlrs in medium-to long-term loans to Brazil. It said on December 31, 1986 its nonperformind Brazilian outstanding debt totaled about 4.1 mln dlrs. First Interstate also has about 168 mln dlrs in short-term loans or trade lines to Brazil. Pinola said he believes the solution to the Brazilian debt crisis will be more political than economic, which he said he finds, "very disquieting and discomforting."  
STEINHARDT GROUP HAS 6.6 PCT OF HOLIDAY &lt;HIA> A group led by New York investor Michael Steinhardt told the Securities and Exchange Commission it bought a 6.6 pct stake in Holiday Corp common stock as an investment.

EXCHANGE RATE BILL CLEARS U.S. HOUSE PANEL The House Banking Committee adopted legislation to direct the U.S. Treasury to begin negotiations aimed at seeking regular adjustment of exchange rates by countries such as Taiwan and South Korea, whose currencies are pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. The measure was adopted as part of a wide-ranging trade bill that will be considered by the full House in April before it moves on to the Senate. The bill's many provisions also set as a priority for the U.S. the negotiation of stable exchange rates and urge government intervention as necessary to offset fluctuations. In addition, the Banking Committee bill would authorize U.S. banks to use a variety of means to deal with the debt problems of developing countries, such as lowering interest rates on existing debt, renegotiating loans or debt forgiveness. The bill would give a blanket waiver of any federal banking regulations that bar such actions. The bill would direct Treasury Secretary James Baker to discuss with debt-ridden developing countries the possibility of the U.S. setting up a public debt management agency that would purchase their debt at a discount and negotiate the restructuring of the debt. The Banking bill authorizes U.S. participation in a multilateral investment guarantee agency (MIGA) as requested by the administration. Congress would approve an initial U.S. subscription of 22 mln dlrs. And, it sets up a council on industrial competitiveness composed of industry and administration members to explore ways to make the U.S. more competitive in world markets.

U.S. HOSUING COMPLETIONS FELL 0.2 PCT IN JANUARY U.S. Completions of new homes fell 0.2 pct in January to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.884 mln units from 1.888 mln in December, the Commerce Department said. The January fall came after a strong 6.4 pct rise from November's rate of 1.774 mln units and brought completions to 6.7 pct above the January, 1986 level of 1.765 mln units. In January, completions of single-family units rose 0.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted 1.183 mln units from 1.178 mln units in December while multi-family units fell 1.3 pct to 701,000 units in January, the department said.  
OLSON &lt;OLSN> TO HAVE LOSS FROM EGG UNIT SALE Olson Industries Inc said it is in final negotiations on the sale of its remaining egg operations and expects the sale to generate a charge of about two mln dlrs against 1987 net income. The company said, however, that the sale will generate substantial cash flow to pay off bank debt and improve working capital, eliminate unmanageable effects on profits of the price instability of the egg business and allow it to concentrate on its plastics packaging business.  
YEUTTER CONCERNED ABOUT U.S. EXPORT PICTURE U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he expects imports to fall soon but he was concerned about the lack of improvement in U.S. exports given the dollar's decline in the last 18 months. "I'm convinced we're about to see an improvement on the import side. I'm more concerned about the export side," he told a House Appropriations subcommittee. Part of the blame goes on other countries which have not generated the economic growth to increase demand for U.S. goods and part to some U.S. companies which are not generating competitive exports, he said.

BAYERNVEREIN EXPECTS UNCHANGED DIVIDEND FOR 1987 Bayerische Vereinsbank AG &lt;BVMG.F> expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987 earnings but profits will only barely reach last year's record levels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said. He told the annual news conference that possible credit risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986. Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from 222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln. Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased slightly and stood around 0.7 pct. Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986. Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks. The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, which excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed two pct to 671 mln marks. The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5 billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said. It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business. The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank business volume rose to 46 pct from 45. Hackl said that in January and February this year, the bank's credit business had not livened up. But despite the sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared with the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.  
REAGAN'S REMARKS HELP GOLD TO RECOVER IN HONG KONG Gold rose by about 50 U.S. Cents an ounce, following a statement by President Ronald Reagan that the arms-for-hostages deal with Iran "was a mistake," dealers said. Bullion rose to 409.40/90 dlrs from an initial low of 408.90/409.40. This compares with the opening of 409.00/50 and New York's close of 410.00/50. Dealers noted mild short-covering in the metal after some initial selling by local investors. Trading was fairly quiet this morning partly owed to the slow U.S. Dollar activities, they added. However, Reagan's remarks had only a short-lived bullish impact on the gold price, which is now stabilising at 409.10/60 dlrs, dealers said. On the local market, the metal traded in a narrow range of 3,800 and 3,805 H.K. Dlrs a tael against yesterday's 3,778 close.  
SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said. Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems, analysts said. But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said. "From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year)," Gail Martell, chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said. The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said. "Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said. The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill. This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the USDA analyst said. With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower. Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however, snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination. "Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness," Martell said. Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the entire winter crop area, she said. Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior forecaster for Accu Weather, said. Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures, the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding, they said. "The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don't have to buy (grains) now," a USDA official said. But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said. Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said. "A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half," Martell said.  
SENS. DANFORTH, BOND ASK TARGETED 0/92 MEASURE Missouri Republican Senators John Danforth and Christopher Bond have introduced a bill that would allow wheat and feedgrain producers along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers hurt by flooding last year to collect at least 92 pct of their deficiency payments this year without planting. Danforth aide Austin Schlick said the bill was similar to a provision included in a House Agriculture Committee-passed emergency disaster assistance bill scheduled to be taken up by the House tomorrow. Schlick said flooding destroyed a number of levees along the two rivers last October, leaving farmland there vulnerable to further damage this year.  
BALL &lt;BLL> TO SUPPLY PENNY BLANKS TO MINTS Ball Corp said it was awarded a one-year 12,750,000 dlr contract to supply copper-plated zinc penny blanks to the U.S. mints in Philadelphia and Denver. The new contract, effective in June, calls for shipping 23,200,000 pounds of blanks to the mint in Philadelphia and 7,600,000 pounds to Denver. It said the blanks will be manufactured in Greenville, Tenn. Ball began supplying blanks to the San Francisco and West Point mints in 1981 when the penny's content was changed to zinc from copper.

EXCO BUYS U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES BROKER &lt;Exco International Plc>, a subsidiary of British and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc &lt;BCOM.L>, said it had agreed in principle to buy an 80 pct stake in &lt;RMJ Holdings Corp> for about 79 mln dlrs. Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was being made from Bank of New York Co Inc &lt;BK.N>, which currently holds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder. Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years. RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of the largest U.S. Government securities brokers. It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and other instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies. Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S. Government securities broker for the past four years and had made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs. B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be bought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting net income of around 16 mln dlrs. The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving of brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled. Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 in the brokerage business and about 70 in its &lt;SMS> unit, which provided computer software for the financial services community. RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total market turnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs a day, and in London where it has 15 billion. It was also given permission last week to open an office in Tokyo where total market turnover had lifted rapidly to about five billion dlrs a day. The acquisition would contribute between five and 10 pct of B and C's share earnings in 1987 on a proforma basis.

PREUSSAG SAYS PAYMENT OF A 1986 DIVIDEND NOT CERTAIN A spokesman for Preussag AG &lt;PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the company would pay a dividend on 1986 results He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said results in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986 following a difficult year in 1985. Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not dipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board. The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in the group's other divisions. The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend partly on the level of provisions. Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before. The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before. Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln. The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector. The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an additional factor behind the drop in results. Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced would not begin to take full effect until this year. Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG. Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison figures. Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0 pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes. Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC) subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of last year. AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by the international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world group losses that year.  
ICO TALKS SET TO END WITH NO QUOTA DEBATE The International Coffee Organization executive board meeting will end tomorrow without any move to reopen the debate on restoring coffee export quotas, delegates said. Talks have focused on administrative matters and verification of stocks in producer countries, they said. Producers met briefly today to exchange views on the market situation but there seems little chance discussion on quotas will begin much before the ICO's annual council session in September, they said. Delegates earlier thought the meeting would end tonight, but a further session is scheduled tomorrow at 1030 GMT to complete reports on stock verification. Meantime, the executive board will meet May 12 to discuss possible action on the consultancy report on the ICO presented today to the board, consumer delegates said.  
CCC CREDITS FOR HONDURAS SWITCHED TO WHITE CORN The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) announced 1.5 mln dlrs in credit guarantees previously earmarked to cover sales of dry edible beans to Honduras have been switched to cover sales of white corn, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The department said the action reduces coverage for sales of dry edible beans to 500,000 dlrs and creates the new line of 1.5 mln dlrs for sales of white corn. All sales under the credit guarantee line must be registered  and shipped by September 30, 1987, it said.  
U.S. SCIENTISTS SAY TROPICAL OILS HEALTH RISK U.S. scientists said some tropical vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at risk because of high levels of saturated fat, lending weight to a campaign by the American Soybean Association (ASA) for labelling changes. The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge, denied by Malaysian palm growers, that imported coconut, palm and palm kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. In a petition filed in January, the ASA asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require palm, palm kernel and coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food manufacturers' labels. The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods. Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and contributes to heart disease are untrue. But Steve Chang, Professor of Food Science at Rutgers University, said, "Palm oil is definitely not good for human health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid." He added that the higher the fatty acid, the greater the blood cholesterol level. "It has been well established that high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart disease," he said. A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official, Borge Bek-Nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil is cholesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancer properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries in humans. Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats daily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than from palm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins A and E. David Kritchevsky, Associate Director of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, appeared to take the ASA view on labelling. "What people really have to learn is to read labels," said Kritchevsky. "The more a consumer knows, the more likely he will make an intelligent choice." The U.S. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm, palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels. Kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, "More saturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...So, from that point of view it's a health risk. High cholesterol levels in the blood are a risk factor for heart disease." Susanne Harris, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food and Consumer Services Division, said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have heart disease. The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid content of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than 20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated. David Ericksen, director of ASA's technical services, said U.S. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273 mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat. Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of U.S. soybean sales in the U.S. market, ASA estimates. U.S. imports of coconut oil during January totaled 82.9 mln lbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in December and 106.5 mln a year earlier, according to Commerce Department figures. Imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3 mln lbs in December and 85.2 mln a year earlier.  
GE &lt;GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER One of General Electric Co's biggest businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs, Wall Street analysts said. Previously, it was expected the business would peak and decline at some point in the next five years. The improved outlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines. "Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order," said Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements for its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie> twinjet long distance aircraft. But AMR said it was using "rent-a-plane leases" that allow it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe downturn in the economy. From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal for several reasons, Heymann said. GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of delivery, Heymann noted. And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc, would have little trouble rounding up another airline that wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said. GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company "no one order will have much of an effect on the stock." Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the order "will help to maintain a good level of production and profitability in the aircraft engine business" for GE. Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs by 1991. Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last year, with well over half of the business in the military sector, according to analysts' estimates. The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides with an upbeat performance in other segments. Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results, he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp that it has a "unique ability" to buy a major business and reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other elements of its 14 business areas. Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates. Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part crediting "significant benefits from the RCA acquisition."  
U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 168 MLN STG HELP The Bank of England said it provided the money market with a further 168 mln stg of assistance to help offset a shortage it now estimated at 1.05 billion stg, revised down from 1.10 billion. It bought 21 mln stg of bank bills outright, 20 mln in band one at 10-3/8 pct and one mln in band two at 10-5/16 pct. In addition, it bought 98 mln stg of bills for resale on March 30 and 49 mln stg for resale April 8 at an interest rate of 10-7/16 pct. All these rates are the same as for today's earlier help. So far today, the bank has provided the market with assistance worth 646 mln stg. The bank also announced the rates applicable to temporary lending facilities rolled over today. The average mid-market rate for lending rolled over for one week is 10-15/16 pct and for two weeks 10-5/8 pct.

The company said its naphtha posting is up three cts a gallon to 43 cts. It said it is raising jet and kerosene postings 2.5 cts, bringing jet to 52.5 cts and kerosene to 51.5 cts. Diesel grades are up two cts, Caltex said, bringing both diesel gas oil (one pct sulfur) and 52-57 D.I. (55 cetane) to 52 cts a gallon, and diesel gas oil (0.5 pct) to 52 cts. The company said it is increasing medium and heavy fuel oil postings by one dlr a barrel. Medium is now 15.50 dlrs a barrel, and heavy fuel is 14.75 dlrs.  
CHINA BUYS U.S. HARD AND SOFT WHEAT Private exporters said China bought a total of 550,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat under the export enhancement program, with final confirmation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture of the subsidies still awaited. The purchase consisted of a total of 340,000 tonnes of hard red winter wheat for various May/Aug shipments, with 210,000 tonnes of soft red winter for Aug/Sept, the exporters said.  
COMMERZBANK INCREASES DIVIDEND, PARENT NET PROFIT Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> said a dividend of nine marks would be proposed for ordinary shareholders on 1986 earnings after eight in 1985. It added in a statement that parent net profit rose to 288.2 mln marks in 1986 from 221.7 mln the prior year. A Commerzbank spokesman noted the figures were,however, preliminary and required approval of the bank's supervisory board which meets today. The Commerzbank statement added the distributable profit last year rose to 228.2 mln marks from 161.7 mln in 1985. With inclusion of the corporate tax allowance, qualifying domestic shareholders would receive an effective dividend of 14.06 marks per share. Total dividend payout would rise to 186.8 mln marks from 142.0 mln on 1985 earnings due to the increase in the dividend and in equity capital, it added. From the parent net profit, 60 mln marks would be placed in published reserves, unchanged from the two prior years. The shareholders' meeting take place on May 22 in Hamburg. The statement said holders of Commerzbank participation certificates in a total nominal value of 425 mln marks would receive the remaining 41.4 mln marks of the distributable profit. Aside from the basic payment of 8.25 pct of nominal value, certificate holders would receive an additional 1.5 pct. The management board of the bank would also propose two capital measures to shareholders in order to be able to react quickly to new challenges. It would ask for authorised capital of a nominal 200 mln marks for the issue of new shares and for 300 mln for the issue of warrant bonds, both for the period until April 30, 1992.

GERMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE LOWERS GROWTH FORECAST The DIW economic research institute said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year. The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than those of the other four leading German institutes, said the economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn. The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter of last year.  
HARRIS CUTS TRIAD SYSTEMS &lt;TRSC> STAKE TO 18 PCT Harris Associates L.P., a Chicago investment advisory partnership, said it lowered its stake in Triad Systems Corp to 1,355,296 shares, or 17.9 pct of the total outstanding, from 1,463,962 shares, or 19.3 pct. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Harris said it sold a net 108,666 Triad common shares between Dec 16 and Feb 23 at prices ranging from 10.00 to 14.25 dlrs a share. It said its dealings in Triad common stock were done on behalf of its advisory client.  
U.S. CONSUMER CREDIT ROSE 536 MLN DLRS IN JAN U.S. consumer instalment credit rose a seasonally adjusted 536 mln dlrs in January after a revised rise of 144 mln dlrs in December, the Federal Reserve Board said. The annual rate of growth in January was 1.1 pct, up from 0.3 pct in December. Previously the Fed said consumer credit rose 105 mln dlrs in December. Among the credit categories, auto credit fell in January to 1.02 billion dlrs from 2.06 billion dlrs in December, the Fed said. Revolving credit in January fell by 366 mln dlrs after rising by 552 mln dlrs in December. Mobile home credit was up by 130 mln dlrs after falling by 21 mln dlrs in December. The category referred to as "other," covering bank and credit union loans, fell by 250 mln dlrs in January after declining by 2.44 billion dlrs in December, the Fed said. Before seasonal adjustment, consumer credit outstanding totaled 580.37 billion dlrs at the end of January, compared with 531.29 billion dlrs at the end of January, 1986.  
TEXACO &lt;TX> TO CEASE POSTING TEXAS OIL PRICE Texaco Refining and Marketing, an operating subsidiary of Texaco Inc, said it would cease to post crude oil prices for West Texas crudes at the end of this month following a decision to discontinue purchase of crude oil from leases, a Texaco spokesman in Houston said. But it will continue to purchase quantities of U.S. and foreign crude oil for use in its refinery system, he added. The spokesman also said Texaco Trading and Transport Inc would continue to acquire and market Texaco lease production as well as other lease production. The company will continue to post a Louisiana price, it said.  
BALLY &lt;BLY> TO TAKE 17.3 MLN DLR 1ST QTR CHARGE Bally Manufacturing Corp said it expects a charge to earnings in the first quarter of this year of 17.3 mln dlrs as a result of its deal to buy back 2.6 mln of its common shares from real estate developer Donald Trump. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Chicago-based hotel, casino, gambling and amusement concern also said the anticipated charge against first quarter earnings will not be deductible for federal income tax purposes. Under a February 21 deal, Bally agreed to buy 2.6 mln of the 3.06 mln shares held by Trump at 24 dlrs a share, or 62.4 mln dlrs, while Trump agreed not to try to seek control of Bally. The agreement also calls for Bally to pay Trump another 6.2 mln dlrs for certain agreements, claims and expenses related to his purchase of the Bally common stock, Bally said. Trump agreed not to buy any more Bally stock or to try to seek control of the company for 10 years, it said. Bear, Stearns and Co Inc signed a similar standstill agreement with Bally for three years, Bally said. But it can still deal in Bally stock as a broker, it said. The deal also obligates Bally to buy Trump's remaining stake in the company for 33 dlrs a share if the stock price does not reach that level by February 21, 1988, it said.  
JAPAN CONSUMER PRICES UNCHANGED IN FEBRUARY Japan's consumer price index (base 1985) was unchanged at 99.7 in February from a month earlier, the government's Management and Coodination Agency said. The index showed a 0.4 pct drop in January. The February index was down one pct from a year earlier for the third consecutive year-on-year drop. In January, the index fell 1.1 pct from a year earlier, the first drop of over one pct since a 1.3 pct drop in September 1958. In February petrol prices increased but winter clothing prices stayed low and vegetable prices fell. The February year on year fall was due to lower vegetable, fuel oil, petrol, electricity and gas prices, and despite higher housing, education, footwear and clothing costs. The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area (base 1985) in mid-March rose 0.4 pct from a month earlier to 100.6, reflecting higher vegetable prices. The index fell 0.3 pct year on year, the third consecutive yearly drop, reflecting lower food and utility costs.

TRADE FRICTION THREATENS TO TOPPLE NAKASONE Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States, political analysts said. Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), they said. "The close relationship between Nakasone and President Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base," Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida told Reuters. "So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages Nakasone." Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax. "Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from Nakasone," Uchida said. "His position within the LDP itself is not so strongly established today." Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support eroded, the analysts said. The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, the analysts said. "Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and Nakasone hasn't worked effectively," Rei Shiratori, director of the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said. This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's credibility, Shiratori told Reuters. The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen's rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said. "If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to resign early," Shiratori said. But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29, some analysts said. However, "unless the Japanese political system can move more quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very hostile audience," said Merrill Lynch Securities economist William Sterling. "If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the final nail in his coffin," he said. Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growing Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts said. But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the differences and aid Nakasone, they said. "One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave," Sterling said.  
KENYAN MINISTER FORECASTS ECONOMIC EXPANSION Kenya's economy will continue to expand this year and the government will do more to encourage investment by foreign firms and the local private sector, Planning Minister Robert Ouko said. He told a news conference that the government would soon create a special bureau to expedite processing of investment applications by local and foreign investors. Praising the role of multinational companies and local entrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised to maintain a close working contact with the private sector. The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in 1985, Ouko said. This was owing to high prices for the country's coffee exports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes, he added. "Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices, Kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987," the planning minister said. Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises announced in February, the minister added. Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the long rainy season, which is due to start about now. Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash crops increased during the second half of last year. Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenya rose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period, he said.  
CLAYTON AND DUBILIER NEW JOINT UNIT TO BUY FIRM Clayton and Dubilier Inc and senior management of a unit of Borg-Warner Corp &lt;BOR> said it will form a new company to buy Borg-Warner's industrial products group for about 240 mln dlrs. Borg-Warner industrial products has sales of about 300 mln dlrs from three divisions, which provide advanced technology fluid transfer and control equipment, systems and services worldwide, Clayton said. The new company will have 3,000 employees and be headquartered in Long Beach, Calif., the company said. Peter Valli, vice president of Borg-Warner Corp and president of its industrial products division, will become president and chief executive officer of the new company, according to Clayton. Clayton, a private investment firm, said this was the third mangement buyout of a divestiture completed by them since December 1986.

ZAMBIAN EXCHANGE AUCTION TO RESUME AT END OF MARCH Zambia will reintroduce a modified foreign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of a new two-tier exchange rate, central bank governor Leonard Chivuno said. Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions and a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other types of business. The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine the kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the end of January. President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had resulted. Business and banking sources said another reason for suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on foreign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful bidders.    The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system was first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15 per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later. Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of about nine kwacha per dollar.  
MINISTER PREDICTS ONE PCT INFLATION FOR SINGAPORE Singapore will have an inflation rate of one pct in 1987, up from a negative 1.4 pct in 1986, Trade and Industry Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament. He said the 1986 drop in the inflation rate, the first fall in a decade, was due largely to lower world prices for oil and oil-related items. But Lee said the negative inflation rate is unlikely to be repeated this year because of projected higher prices for primary commodities and oil.

OIL PRICES SAID NOW BASED ON FUTURES PRICE Energy futures now set the standard for oil pricing, said Arnold Safer, president of The Energy Futures Group Inc, a consulting firm. "Petroleum futures trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange literally set spot market prices in the U.S.," he said, adding that some oil products sellers now offer contracts based on a daily average of NYMEX prices. He also said that petroleum futures are a major market for oil companies as well as for commodity traders. His remarks were made at the National Petroleum Refiners Association.

YUGOSLAVIA WHEAT FREE OF WINTERKILL - USDA There was no evidence of winterkill in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S. Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field report. The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall because of dry conditions. However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on last fall's late seeding, it said. Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the report said. Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage under these conditions, they said. The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it emerged from winter.

DEUTSCHE BANK SEES SLOW START TO 1987 Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> has seen a slow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986, management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said. Credit business declined in the first few weeks of the year, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weak German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, and trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency dealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference. Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78 billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion. Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the former Flick group, which have been estimated at some one billion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank's own account, not included in partial operating profits. Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a subsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interest surplus in a section current earnings from securities and participations. In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from 1.45 billion. As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits. But it said that total operating profits, including own account trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick transaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the parent bank. Banking analysts said this put group total operating profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bank operating profits at over five billion marks. Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its unchanged 12 mark dividend. The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986, and developments so far this year showed that was correct, Christians said. West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent years, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits. The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a high level of risk provision, Christians said. Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in 1986 from 765 mln in 1985. Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarily reflect the full amount of risk provisions. Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said Deutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985 because of the fall in the dollar. He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of such problem country debt had been written off. Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of "other securities," to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the parent bank. Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due to its increased activity in international share placements, with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA's international placement last year remaining on its books. Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to place these shares and conclude the original placement.

VIACOM &lt;VIA> MERGER EXPECTED IN 60 TO 90 DAYS Sumner Redstone, president of National Amusements, Inc, predicted he can win regulatory approvals to wrap up the 3.4 billion dlr acquisition of Viacom International Inc in 60 to 90 days. Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues of entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and their financial backers decided not to top National's bid. "We've had counsel working for some time in every region where Viacom has cable televison systems" Redstone told Reuters in a telephone interview. Redstone also said "Viacom is committed to working very closely with us to obtain approvals." Viacom has been seeking approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable systems since September when its management group first advanced a buyout plan. But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into a defintive merger agreement with National. National is a family business which operates a chain of movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom. Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years. Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom, four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the emerging trend. "Up until recently you could see any motion picture on any pay channel," Redstone said. He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month. Redstone said the management group's investment bankers will be paid what is due for termination of its merger agreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. "That will be a company expense," Redstone said. He said BankAmerica &lt;BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiries from lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr financing for the deal. BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs. After the merger, Viacom will be a subsidiary of National but 17 pct of the company will be in public hands.

CONSECO &lt;CNC> TO BUY BENEFICIAL &lt;BNL> UNIT Conseco Inc said it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Western National Life Insurance Co from Beneficial Corp for 275 mln dlrs in cash. Western National had assets of 1.9 billion dlrs at the end of 1986 and 1986 premium and investment revenues.  Western issues structured settlement annuities for the settlement of personal injury and damage claims and sells tax-sheltered annuities. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval. Conseco said the acquisition would raise its assets to 2.7 billion dlrs and annual revenues to about 800 mln dlrs. Beneficial had previously announced plans to leave the insurance business.  On March Three, it said it agreed in principle to sell its American Centennial Insurance Co, Beneficial International Insurance Co, Consolidated MArine and General Insurance Co Ltd, Consolidated Life Assurance Co Ltd, Wesco Insurance Co and Service General Insurance Co subsidiaries to a management-led group for 98 mln dlrs in notes mostly contingent on performance of the units and 10 mln dlrs in cash. Conseco had 1986 operating earnings of 4,968,000 dlrs on revenues of 84.9 mln dlrs.

SHEARSON LEHMAN UPGRADES U.S. OIL STOCKS Analyst Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers said he recommended a number of oil stocks today now that it is apparent that OPEC has succeeded in holding to its prescribed production quotas. "It is clear that OPEC, through jawboning and quota restraint, will boost the price of oil," Margoshes said. Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response to higher oil prices and optimism about OPEC quotas. Margoshes said he recommends Imperial Oil &lt;IMO.A>, up 1/2 to 49-1/8, Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD>, 7/8 to 62-3/4, Exxon &lt;XON> one to 83-1/8, and Chevron &lt;CHV> 1-1/8 to 54-7/8. In addition, Margoshes said he recommended Atlantic Richfield &lt;ARC> on a short-term basis, though he said he is still suspect about its debt situation. Atlantic Richfield rose 1-3/4 to 77. He said "the market could come down to test the 16 dlr a barrel level again, but the main thrust of investing in oil is positive right now. Before the year is out we will see higher oil prices." He noted that belief that the government is interested in raising the strategic reserves is factored into the rise in oil stocks today.  
SECURITY PACIFIC &lt;SPC> BUYS ORBANCO &lt;ORBN> Security Pacific Corp said it completed its previously announced acquisition of Orbanco Financial Services Corp after receiving federal approval of the deal. Security Pacific said the Federal Reserve Board approved on Wednesday its purchase of the Portland, Ore.-based bank holding company and financial services concern. The purchase of Orbanco, for about 47 mln dlrs in cash and common stock, will be effective in 30 days, a Security Pacific spokeswoman said. Terms call for each share of Orbanco common stock to be exchanged for about 14 dlrs of Security Pacific common stock, plus 1.50 dlrs cash. Each share of Orbanco's 100-dlr par value preferred stock will be exchanged for 100 dlrs cash, plus accrued dividends. Orbanco, with one billion dlrs in assests, is the holding company for the Oregon Bank, Orbanco Real Estate Service Co, American Data Service Inc and Orbanco Securities Corp. Security Pacific now has four major regional bank purchases outside California completed or pending. Security Pacific bought The Arizona Bank, with assets of four billion dlrs, in the fourth quarter of 1986. Pending approval currently is the purchase of Rainier Bancorporation &lt;RBAN>, with assets of 9.2 billion dlrs. In anticipation of legislative changes that take effect in 1989, Security Pacific has also negotiated the future purchase of The Nevada Bank, with assets of 615 mln dlrs. Security Pacific is the sixth largest U.S. bank holding company, with assets of about 61.60 billion dlrs.

BULLETIN SAYS TIN PRICE MAY RISE TO 20 RINGGIT The tin price is likely to rise to 20 ringgit a kilo this year because of the producers' accord on export quotas and the reluctance of brokers and banks to sell the metal at lower prices, a Malaysian government bulletin said. The Malaysian Tin bulletin said it is in producers' interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to 90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnes overhang. It said consumption by industrialised countries should stay at 160,000 tonnes and that International Tin Council creditors and brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessively unless there is a large and abrupt price jump. The continued depreciation of the dollar could also help push up the price of tin, the bulletin said. A depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of the ringgit which is closely pegged to it, making the price of tin cheaper in sterling terms, it added. "Even in the absence of economic rationale in the tin market, psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure a price recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo," the bulletin said.  
NORWAY'S TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FEBRUARY Norway's trade deficit widened in February to 957 mln crowns from 80 mln crowns in January and 492 mln crowns in February last year, the Central Bureau of Statistics said. Exports dropped to 10.66 billion crowns last month, compared with 11.11 billion in January and 10.85 billion in February 1986, it added. Crude oil and natural gas exports totalled 4.56 billion crowns in February, against 5.10 billion in January and 5.36 billion a year ago.  
TOTAL STILL EXPECTS 1.5 BILLION FRANC 1986 LOSS French oil group Total Cie Francaise des Petroles &lt;TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc consolidated net loss, including minority interests, for 1986, after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs, the company said in a communique after a board meeting here. In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs. Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total's refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France &lt;RAFF.PA>, told journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the subsidiary before stock depreciation. CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16 billion loss in 1985. But its net loss last year, taking account of that depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985. In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from 20.9 mln "due to the growth in imports by independent distributors following a relaxation of regulations," Guilbaud said. The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000 this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a job reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln francs, he said. Concerning business in 1987, he said that "January was a good month, but the situation deteriorated in February."

SOSNOFF SAYS CAESARS &lt;CAW> OFFERED STOCK BUYBACK Martin Sosnoff, who has offered to buy Caesars World Inc for 28 dlrs a share, said senior officials of the company have offered to buy back the Caesars stake he already holds, now 13.6 pct of the total outstanding. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, said the offers to buy back his stock occurred "on several occasions during the past year." The offers were made by several Caesars World representatives, including its chairman, Henry Gluck, he said. Sosnoff said he rejected all of the proposals. The Caesars World official suggested various forms of payment for Sosnoff's stake, including other securities of the company and cash, he said. Sosnoff did not detail the value of the proposed compensation. Also suggested was a deal involving "put" and "call" option regarding Sosnoff's Caesars World holdings, he said. The proposed deals would have also included a "standstill" agreement, which would have restricted Sosnoff's right to buy more Caesars World stock or "to take any action adverse to incumbent management," he said. Sosnoff's report on the offers he received for his Caesars World shares were amended to his official offer to purchase the company, as well as reported to the SEC. Sosnoff now holds about 4.1 mln Caesars World shares, or 13.6 pct of the company's 30 mln shares outstanding. The Sosnoff offer to buy the shares of the company he does not already hold has been valued at 725.2 mln dlrs.

WHITE HOUSE DISCOUNTS THREAT OF TRADE WAR President Reagan has reaffirmed his opposition to protectionism and his chief spokesman said trade sanctions imposed on Japan were unlikely to start a trade war. "We don't want to go down that road," Reagan was quoted as telling Prime Minister Jacques Chirac after the visiting French official expressed concern about the rising tide of protectionist sentiment in the United States. Later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the new sanctions against Japan and said administration officials "do not believe this will result in a trade war." "It is the first time that the United States has taken an action of this type and it is significant but it is nothing to be alarmed about," the presidential spokesman added. "We do not want protectionism ... We do not want a trade war," he said. Fitzwater said the president was forced to act in the Japanese microchip case because Tokyo had failed to fulfill "an agreement to make some corrections." Noting that there are "enormous pressures in the Congress and the land" for the United States to take a tough stand, he said, "This was a case where we felt we simply had to act." Fitzwater said the decision to impose sanctions was "well considered by this administration and not taken lightly." While the White House official held open the possibility that Washington and Tokyo will settle their trade dispute, he indicated a settlement probably would not come in time to head off the sanctions. "We are always open to negotations ... Whether it (a settlement) could occur in time to prevent this (the sanctions) from going into effect is questionable at this point," the spokesman said. The sanctions take effect in mid-April.

NAVISTAR &lt;NAV> UP ON HIGHER EARNINGS OPINION Navistar International Corp's stock rose after brokerage house Sanford C. Bernstein and Co raised its earnings estimate of the company based on expectations of better truck orders and truck tonnage, traders said. Navistar led the active list with a gain of 1/4 to 7-1/4 on volume of 4.2 mln shares. Traders familiar with the opinion said that David Eisenberg, director of Sanford C. Bernstein and Co's institutional strategy committee, raised his earnings estimates to 80 cts a share for the current fiscal year ending in October. He expects Navistar to earn 1.20 dlrs a share next year. In 1986, the company lost 14 cts a share. Eisenberg was unavailable for comment.  
IMPERIAL OIL &lt;IMO.A> TO FOCUS ON HIGHER PROFIT Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, will focus on maintaining its financial strength and improving near-term earnings performance through operating expense reductions and selective capital spending, the company said in the annual report. Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs on capital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648 mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985. Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fell to 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27 dlrs share in the prior year. Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results from the desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities should the investment climate improve and the belief that low or volatile crude oil prices could continue during the next several years. The company also said actions initiated during 1986 to restructure and improve efficiency should continue to show benefits in 1987. During 1986, the company cut operating, administrative and marketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number of workers by 16 pct to 12,500. Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual report that it is too early to determine whether the recent upward movement in international oil prices will be sustained. "It is still a time for prudence and caution, and the company's actions will continue to be based on the fundamentals of market supply and demand," he said. Haynes said prospects for the company's petroleum products division are more promising than before, but are still uncertain. Imperial's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln dlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985. Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its petroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in the United States. The company's chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynes said. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as long as economic growth continues, but future large grain surpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure on prices. Imperial's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986, compared to three mln dlrs in 1985.  
JAPAN SET TO RIDE OUT YEN RISE, OFFICIALS SAY The government is determined to ride out the latest sharp rise of the yen without taking panic measures because it expects the currency's appreciation to prove temporary, senior officials said. "The market has already located a ceiling (for the yen) and market forces are pushing the dollar back up a bit," one senior Finance Ministry official said. He attributed the dollar's fall in recent days to special factors, in particular, selling by Japanese investors ahead of the March 31 end to their fiscal year. That selling largely came to an end this morning after about one hour of trading here, the senior official said. "They (the investors) became more or less quiet after 10 o'clock (0100 GMT)," he said. After falling to a record low of 144.70 yen this morning, the dollar edged back up in late trading to end at 146.20. Dealers attributed the late rise to remarks by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that major nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar above 150 yen. Several officials said they did not see any fundamental reason for the dollar's recent sharp fall. One official even called the market's recent actions irrational. If anything, the U.S. Decision to slap tariffs on Japanese electronics goods should support the dollar against the yen because it will cut Japanese exports to the U.S., He said. As a result, several officials said they saw no reason to alter the broad thrust of government policy agreed to at last month's meeting of major nations in Paris. "We don't see any substantial reason to change our policy stance," one senior official said.  
(CORRECTED) - MOBIL &lt;MOB> TO UPGRADE REFINERY UNIT Mobil Corp said it will spend over 30 mln dlrs to upgrade a gasoline-producing unit at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery. It said the unit is a catalytic reformer, which converts low-octane components of gasoline into high-octane components for use in Super Unleaded gasoline. The company said the modernization will allow the unit to regenerate catalysts on a continuous basis without shutdown. Currently, it must be shut twice a year.  The unit produces 46,000 barrels of gasoline components a day.  Construction will start late this year, with completion set for mid-1989. (Correcting unit's output to barrels/day from barrels/year)  
U.S. PAYMENTS GAP TO PERSIST, EX-FED CHIEF SAYS The dollar will decline over the next two to three years, but this is unlikely to result in a complete reduction of the U.S. current account deficit, said Anthony Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg (USA) Inc and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon said without elaboration that he expects a "significant decline in the dollar," within the next three years. "The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficit will stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core," he said. Solomon described the structural core as about one-half of the current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited several factors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit. For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any new investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when the dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said. In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increased propensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes. Solomon forecast inflation at 4.5 pct by year-end, but said it could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oil prices are stable and commodity values remain low.

YEUTTER SEES U.S., JAPAN VERGING ON TRADE CONFLICT The United States and Japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade, especially over semiconductors, Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy U.S. Super-computers, and barriers to U.S. Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks. European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT. Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes. New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked. The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts. Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years. "Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is, maybe, five or six years in the future." He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago. "That's a very healthy development," he added."If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist." "Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit," Yeutter said. "They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago." He added, "Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter."

BALLADUR SEES ONLY TWO PCT FRENCH GROWTH IN 1987 French 1987 growth will probably be about two pct, the same as last year, due to an international environment that is less favourable than expected, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur was quoted as saying. Treasury director Daniel Lebegue said last month that gross domestic product is expected to grow by between two and 2.5 pct this year, against an original target of 2.8 pct. Although in line with the latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimate of 2.1 pct growth, the forecast will be balanced by growth in investments and exports, Balladur said in an interview with the daily Les Echos. Last month Balladur said French GDP had grown by just two pct last year, compared with an initial 1986 target of 2.5 pct and 1.1 pct growth in 1985. He told Les Echos he aims to reduce the 1988 budget deficit to 115 billion francs from this year's figure of 129 billion and compared with a 141 billion deficit in 1985. He has already announced his intention of cutting the deficit to 100 billion francs in 1989.  
PORK DELEGATES VOTE ON FARM BILL, FARM CREDIT Delegates from the National Pork Producers Council, NPPC, attending the American Pork Congress in Indianapolis, voted overwhelmingly to recommend the U.S. congress not to change the farm bill. While there are no specific pork items in that legislation, feed grain prices directly affect pork producer profits, the NPPC said. Don Gingerich, a delegate from Iowa, said "to have unpredictable changes come along periodically makes it very difficult to plan and causes a lot of disruption." Other members said the farm bill has some imperfections but that's a price pork producers are willing to pay for legislative stability, an NPPC spokesman said. Delegates also passed unanimously a resolution that Congress and the administration should act swiftly to identify problems in the farm credit system. Farm Credit Task Force chairman and newly elected Vice President of the NPPC Ray Hankes, said delegates wanted a program that all commodity groups can work with and bring a resolution to this problem with legislators in Washington. Hankes added that the National Pork Producers Council will work to save farmers and keep credit available, but not to save or create any one credit system.

EC MAY OFFER INTERVENTION SUGAR TO LOCAL MARKET Sugar which EC producers plan to sell into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for sale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in its latest sugar review. The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very nominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the intervention price, with detrimental consequences for producers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar. The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course, such as removing the time limit on storage contracts, which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September, Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced. If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference between the EC price and the world market price, the extra costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says. The producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy, Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under EC rules. The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price, Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of protest designed to force the Commission's hand. In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for intervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure that the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in 1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price, West German producers face a further price reduction in July with a probable revaluation of the "green" mark. Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is not expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared to traders for some years that the EC's export policy is insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, it says. The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says, suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut down the amount of "unnecessary bureaucracy" surrounding the export tender system.  
JAPAN OFFICIALS SEE DIFFICULTY HITTING GNP TARGET The government will find it very difficult to achieve its new gross national product (GNP) forecast of three pct growth in the fiscal year ending March 31, Economic Planning Agency officials said. They made the comment to reporters after news that GNP rose 0.8 pct in the October/December quarter, after a 0.7 pct increase the previous three months. For Japan to achieve three pct growth in 1986/87, GNP in the January/March period would have to grow 2.6 pct from October/December, the officials said. The government lowered its GNP forecast for 1986/87 from four pct last December.  
BRITAIN WARNS JAPAN OVER TRADE ROW British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard told Japan to resolve the row over the U.K. Firm Cable and Wireless Plc's &lt;CAWL.L> shareholding in a new Japanese telecommunications company or face an abrupt deterioration in trade relations. In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunications ministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the way Tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing trade imbalance between the two countries. "I put it to the (post and telecommunications) minister that I was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world," Howard told reporters. "He listened very carefully and I have little doubt the message got home," he added. British frustration over the lopsided trade balance - nearly six billion dlrs in Japan's favour last year - has reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue, Howard said. Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and Wireless from having a major role in the international telephone market in Japan. "I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as I want a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in trading relations," Howard said. "We simply aren't prepared to continue to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a long time." Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unable to comment on Howard's meeting with their minister. But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are increasing, but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade. Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications dispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied. Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the telecommunications issue. "There are measures which are under consideration if we continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations," he added, but gave no details. He said he had received a reassuring response from the Japanese he has spoken with. "But of course we've had reassuring signs from the Japanese for quite some time," he added. "What I've made plain is we expect to see action." Howard ruled out using powers in Britain's Financial Services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices. Those powers, which allow London to ban foreign financial firms like banks from Britain, are designed to ensure U.K. Firms equal access to overseas financial markets.

IRAQ REPORTS ATTACKS ON SUPERTANKER, OIL TARGETS Iraq said its warplanes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends. The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action. It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday. A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time. The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January. The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it. In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack. But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours. The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March 8, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg. Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said.

U.S. EEP VEG OIL PROPOSALS STILL UNDER REVIEW U.S. Agriculture Department proposals to offer 260,000 tonnes of subsidized vegetable oil to four countries are still under consideration by an interagency trade policy group, a USDA official close to the group said. The official, who asked not to be identified, dismissed a report circulating in markets today that the interagency trade policy review group had rejected the proposals. Under the proposals, USDA would offer vegetable oil under the export enhancement program, EEP, to four countries, including 80,000 tonnes to Turkey and 60,000 tonnes to Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, industry sources said. The proposals "are still under review" by the interagency working group, the USDA official said.  
NORWAY'S WHOLESALE PRICES RISE 0.5 PCT IN FEBRUARY Norway's wholesale price index (base 1981) rose 0.5 pct in February to 136.0 after a 1.7 pct rise in January to 135.0, the Central Bureau of Statistics said. The year on year increase for February was 7.9 pct compared with 5.7 pct in January and 2.2 pct in February 1986, it added.

HUMANA &lt;HUM> DECLARES SHAREHOLDERS RIGHTS PLAN Humana Inc said its board approved a shareholder rights plan, or so-called poison pill plan, to ensure its shareholders receive fair treatment in the event of a proposed takeover. Humana said it is now aware of any effort to gain control of the company. Under the plan its board declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding common share held as of March 16. It said each right entitles holders to purchase a unit of 1/100 of a share of newly authorizes series A participating preferred at 75 dlrs per unit. Humana said the rights become effective after an entity acquires 20 pct or more of its outstanding common or tenders for 30 pct of its stock. After such an acquisition, then each right entitles holders to purchase securities of the company or an acquiring entity having a market value of twice the right's exercise price. Humana said the rights expire March 4, 1997, unless redeemed earlier. It said the rights may be redeemed by the company for one ct per right at any time prior to 10 days following a public announcement that a 20 pct position has been acquired.

DEUTSCHE BABCOCK SEES HIGHER 1986/87 PROFITS Deutsche Babcock AG &lt;DBCG.F> expects profits to rise in the current financial year ending September 9 although the earnings level is still unsatisfactory, managing board chairman Helmut Wiehn said. He told a news conference that business during the year had weakened somewhat but was still generally positive. Sales during the first five months to February was 1.26 billion marks, 46.7 pct down from the same 1985/86 period. However, he expected turnover for the year to be approximately unchanged from the previous year's 5.14 billion marks when current orders from major projects are booked. Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end- February totalled 2.50 billion marks compared with 2.04 billion for the same period in 1985/86. They included a 45.8 pct increase in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks. Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at 8.64 billion marks. Wiehn added that Babcock was still aiming for a three pct yield on turnover. In the year to September 1986 group profits totalled 39 mln marks on sales of 5.14 billion against the previous year's 32 mln on 5.11 billion marks. Parent company turnover was unchanged at 25.6 mln marks. Wiehn said Babcock's liquidity had clearly improved in the current business year, with financial reserves in the first five months rising by 237 mln marks to 831 mln after increasing by 408 mln marks to 594 mln in 1985/86. He said pre-tax earnings per share for 1985/86, according to the DVFA method, were 26.95 marks from 21.40 marks and earnings after tax rose to 10 marks from 8.10. The company earlier said dividend will be unchanged at three marks for ordinary shares and 3.50 marks for preference shares.

AROUND 3.5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0/92 A 0/92 program would have very little impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only an additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, according to a report from the Agriculture Department. The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said. The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92 acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley. Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested. "The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite small," the report said. "The returns on typical farms still favor participation in the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted acreage," the USDA report said. The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment, would be most used by producers in high production/high risk areas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins, director of USDA's economics analysis staff. "In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much participation," Collins said. USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton. Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels of sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales of cotton, the report said. "In determining whether to participate, a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered," according to the analysis. "What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production," Collins said. For producers with low production costs, that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said. Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along with 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be more attractive. Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 0/92 program. "I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first, but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments," Collins said. In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and Feed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month.  
NPPC DELEGATES APPROVE DISEASE AND DRUG PROGRAMS Delegates from the National Pork Producers Council, NPPC, yesterday approved programs for control and eradication of pseudorabies and establishment of a national safe drug use program. The delegate body, attending the American Pork Congress in Indianapolis, approved a pseudorabies control and eradication program at the state level after a recommendation from NPPC's PRV (pseudorabies virus) oversight committee. The PRV committee received results of a three year, five state pilot project which had a 97.5 pct success rate in eradication of the disease within 116 hog herds. The project was jointly funded by the USDA and NPPC. "Primarily it (the program) allows individual states to deal with their own problems according to a timetable that suits them best," Mike Wehler, member of the NPPC's PRV oversight committee said. In regards to safe drug use, the delegates approved a plan asking that NPPC be active in establishing a national safe drug use program. The program would establish better relationships between producers and veterinarians and eventually lead to a quality assurance program in pork production, according to the plan. "This program basically communicates to the FDA that we are concerned about safe drug use and will do our part to use drugs safely, if FDA will allow the same policy to continue in effect," Wehler said.

USDA REPORTS 10.572 MLN ACRES IN CONSERVATION The U.S. Agriculture Department has accepted 10,572,402 more acres of highly erodable cropland into the Conservation Reserve Program, USDA announced. In the latest signup, farmers on 101,020 farms submitted bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres. The accepted bids for annual rental payments ranged up to 90 dlrs per acre with an average of 51.17 dlrs per acre. Land entered into the Conservation Reserve Program will be ineligible for farming for ten years and must be planted with permanent vegetative cover. Producers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in the conservation program to take advantage of a corn "bonus" rental payment that was offered by USDA. The corn bonus, to be paid in generic comodity certificates, amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the ASCS program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn based accepted into the reserve. The state showing the biggest enrollment in the conservation program during this signup was Texas with approximately 1.225 mln acres, followed by Iowa with 1.030 mln acres, Minnesota with 890,000 acres, Montana 875,000 acres, and Kansas with 842,000 acres. Other states showing big enrollment were Missouri with 646,000 acres, North Dakota with 588,000 acres, and Nebraska with 554,000 acres. In the corn belt states of Illinois and Indiana, 217,000 acres and 116,000 acres respectively were enrolled. Farm land signed up to date in the conservation program totals 19,488,587 acres. Bids on the previous signups ranged up to 90 dlrs per acre with an average of 45.52 dlrs.  
INFINITY &lt;INFTA> TO PURCHASE AM/FM STATION Infinity Broadcasting Corp said it entered an agreement to acquire radio stations KVIL AM/FM from Sconninx Broadcasting Co for 82 mln dlrs.

NACCO INDUSTRIES &lt;NC> TO REPORT 2ND QTR GAIN Nacco Industries Inc said it will report a gain in the second quarter of about 11.5 mln dlrs or 1.25 dlrs a share from the sale of stock of a subsidiary. Nacco said its North American Coal Corp unit has received notice that Consolidation Coal Co, a unit of Du Pont Co &lt;DD>, will exercise an option to buy all of the stock of Quarto Mining Co, a subsidiary of North American Coal. For the stock, North American Coal will receive about 15.2 mln dlrs, 5.2 mln of which will be paid at closing April 10 and the rest in installments, the company said. In addition, Quarto will pay a dividend to North American Coal of about 10 mln dlrs from retained earnings before closing. The funds were previously used to finance mining operations. Consolidation Coal got the option from the Capco Group of utilities, which received the option from Nacco in 1981. Nacco reported earnings of 10.8 mln dlrs or 1.11 dlrs a share in last year's second quarter. In 1986, Quarto generated 5.9 mln dlrs in net income, equal to 62 cts a share, of Nacco's total 1986 earnings of 3.48 dlrs a share. Quarto produced about 3.6 mln short tons of the 24.3 mln tons produced by North American Coal in 1986, Nacco said.  
ISRAELI INFLATION RATE IS 1.0 PCT IN FEBRUARY Israel's inflation rate for February was one pct, compared to 2.1 pct in January and 1.6 pct in February 1986, a spokesman for the Central Bureau of Statistics said. Inflation for the 12 months ending in February was 23 pct, the spokesman said. February price rises were mostly in housing, health, education, entertainment and transport. Wage and price controls have been in force since August 1985. Officials said the controls have helped soften the effect of a recent 10 pct devaluation of the shekel.  
U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER SEES EXPANSION CONTINUING Treasury Secretary James Baker said that the current expansion, which he noted was in its fifth year, will continue in the period ahead. He told the House Appropriations Committee that "there is every prospect that the current expansion will continue unabated through 1987 and the years beyond." Baker said interest rates over the period have continued to decline and that "policies of the Federal Reserve assure that ample credit was available. He said that the administration's longer term forecast envisioned that "we will maintain and improve upon our progress in bringing down the rate of inflation."

BRAZIL STRIKES CAUSE GOVERNMENT MAJOR PROBLEMS Strikes by Brazil's 40,000 seamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing major headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt crisis. A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25 years and union leaders say they have seriously affected Brazilian exports by making idle 160 ships. On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest payments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp deterioration in its trade balance. Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most petrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country's industrial heartland, and in three other states closed down to press for higher fuel prices. There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage. The seamen's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the 72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras. The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today entitled "Dangerous Confrontation," said: "From the economic point of view the seamen's strike carries an alarming cost, with grave consequences for the supply situation and for the country's external trade." The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected offers of up to 100 pct. Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due to rule on whether the seamen's strike is legal. But a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardless of the tribunal's ruling. Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse over the last few months of the government's Cruzado Plan price freeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Not only workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol station owners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao Paulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of Curitiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for exceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions. Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their profits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados (six U.S. Cents) a litre from 0.56 cruzados (about 2.5 cents). Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last night as motorists filled up their tanks while they still could. Political sources said the government of President Jose Sarney was closely following the strikes and the overall fuel supply situation.  
TROPICAL FOREST DEATH COULD SPARK NEW DEBT CRISIS The death of the world's tropical rain forests could trigger a new debt crisis and social and biological disasters, scientists and ecologists involved with the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) said. At stake is the ability of developing nations, including Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines, to service their debts and the loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in important sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals, they said. The experts, gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of consumers and producers near Tokyo next week, said the problem is already acute. The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic dangers. "For many third world nations, the loss of the forest is not just a loss of resources," said Delfin Ganapin, a Philippine government consultant on environmental impact. "In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest, now we have one mln. We have only around 10 years of profitable logging left. With a 26 billion dlr debt, the loss of logging foreign exchange earnings is serious," he said. About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that are now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops. Government security advisers say that as a direct result, the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in the upland areas, said Ganapin. Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods have less than a 50 pct chance of survival. There is no known way to reproduce the wood, or the millions of species within. "No replanting programme has been successful," said Almy Hafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation. Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next two years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded land in the Philippines. The experts say that without a major initiative from the development banks, the vicious circle will continue with countries cutting more forest to help service short-term debts at the cost of long-term insolvency. Yet timber, a five billion dlr a year industry, is not necessarily the most direct economic product of the forests, and nations must be educated in how best to "farm" them, said Peter Kramer, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director. There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end products of rattan, and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a year, he said. U.S. Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that 25 pct of all U.S. Prescriptions owe their active ingredients to higher plants growing in the forests. Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further discoveries and force major corporations to research, develop and produce man-made substitutes, at a cost which scientists say is incalculable. By the year 2000, only 10 developing nations will still be exporting timber, from 33 currently, and their export earnings will drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than two billion, a World Bank and U.N. Sponsored survey said. Of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank, Inter-American, African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84, only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects, it said. WWF statistics show half of the world's tropical forests have vanished since the 1940s. Of 2,000 mln hectares remaining, up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive logging practises and by local farmers.

CHINA CLOSES SECOND ROUND OF OFFSHORE OIL BIDS China has closed the second round of bidding by foreign firms for offshore oil exploration rights, the China Daily has reported. It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) as saying China signed eight contracts with 15 foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km. Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one well has so far produced results -- Lufeng 13-1-1, 250 km south-east of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day. The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies. The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round. China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37 companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore exploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were terminated after no oil was discovered. Foreign firms have invested 2.1 billion dlrs on offshore China since 1979.

BAT SHARES UNDERVALUED, SAY STOCK MARKET ANALYSTS BAT Industries Plc &lt;BTI.L> 1986 results, which were at the upper end of market expectations, showed the company was in a strong position and that its shares were probably undervalued, share analysts said. BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon trading after a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538p earlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39 billion pre-tax. Stock market analysts said today's generally weak stock market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BAT shares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in the share price. "In the current market, people almost expect companies to beat expectations," said one analyst, adding that pretax profits of 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast. BAT's 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985 pretax profit of 1.17 billion. Brokers noted that BAT's shift away from its underperforming industries and the decreasing share of the tobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs. BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that the tobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74 pct four years ago. Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the company declining further as other sectors increased in importance. He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financial services, in particular in the U.S. Sheehy also said the group had "no sizeable acquisitions" in sight in the near future. Analysts said BAT's increasingly good performance in the U.K. Insurance area was encouraging. Its declining debt-to-equity ratio of currently about 16 pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to make major acquisitions, they said.  
LESS GRAIN FLOWS INTO WEST GERMAN INTERVENTION The West German Intervention Board said it accepted 962,192 tonnes of grain from the start of the current agricultural year to the end of last month, compared with 1.8 mln tonnes during the July/February period in 1985/86. It said it accepted 336,097 tonnes of bread wheat (nil in the year-earlier period), 16,818 (nil) tonnes of high quality wheat, 33,623 (523,625) tonnes of feed wheat, 3,426 (168,682) tonnes of rye, 88,494 (32,766) tonnes of high quality rye, 2,313 (105,005) tonnes of summer barley and 481,421 (972,794) tonnes of winter barley.

BOLIVIAN MINERS CALL GENERAL STRIKE About 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation, Comibol, declared a general strike as from midnight (0400 gmt) to press for higher salaries, a statement by the federation for Bolivian mine workers said. It said the strike was called to defend the nationalised mining industry. The miners were willing to negotiate with the government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, but only if it showed an intention to meet the strikers' demands. The government said the strike was designed to cause it embarrassment during the four-day visit of West German President Richard Von Weizsaecker, which starts on Friday. The miners statement said police had violently evicted Comibol office workers in the city of Oruro after they began a hunger strike yesterday. The government has sacked about 20,000 miners from its deficit-ridden corporation since the collapse in the international price of tin. The lay-offs represent about two-thirds of the original workforce.

ROSTENKOWSKI OPPOSES PROTECTIONIST TRADE BILL House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation to pass a protectionist trade bill this year. In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year. But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the trade bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn other countries their access to the American market would be curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods. "Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness," Rostenkowski said. "It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the American market," he added. However, he said there would likely be changes in the market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States.  
ECUADOR CRUDE OIL EXPORTS STOPPED FOR FIVE MONTHS Ecuador needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to its oil export pipeline caused by last week"s earthquake, which will stop crude exports for five months, energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said. Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc &lt;TX.N> and a Mexican and an Argentine firm. President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that Ecuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exports for four months due to the quake. Oil traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of Ecuador's total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired. The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, Patricio Quevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a 180-day period. He added the Caracas-based Andean Development Corp had granted a loan of 11.7 mln dlrs towards repairing the pipeline, 50 km of which had been damaged in the quake. In Quito, Foreign Minister Rafael Garcia Velasco yesterday summoned ambassadors from about 40 countries to whom he issued appeal for emergency aid for the country. Only three countries, the U.S., Colombia and Venezuela, had offered assistance.

U.S. HOUSE PANEL EASES SOVIET EXPORT CONTROLS The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now kept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer a threat to U.S. national security. The Democratic-controlled committee said the administration's export control policies, which restrict shipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year's record 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit. The committee said the legislation will cut government red tape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available from other countries. Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International Economic Policy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had cost the U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year. "This is Congress' number one opportunity to attack the trade deficit in a positive way by exporting more," the Washington Democrat said. The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift controls on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable controls. Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of technology such as medical instruments. It would also give the Commerce Department primary authority to decide which exports will be permitted and limit the Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewing requests to export highly-sensitive technology.  
BP &lt;BP> TO HOLD NEW YORK PRESS CONFERENCE British Petroleum Co PLC said it has scheduled a New York press conference for 1300 EST/1800 gmt today at which senior management will discuss the company's proposed acquisition of the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> that it does not already own for 70 dlrs per share.

MAJOR U.S. BANKS MOVE TO HIGHER 7-3/4 PCT PRIME Most major U.S. banks today matched Tuesday's quarter-point prime rate cuts by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank, the first prime rate boosts since mid-1984. Most cited narrower spreads between the prime and funding costs as justification. Analysts said the prime rate rises may have been triggered partly by a desire by banks to enhance profit margins given problems with developing country loans. Commenting on the prime rate increases, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker told a House Appropriations Committee that "I hope it was a temporary blip upward." Among the major banks which today announced prime rate increases to 7-3/4 pct were Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank, Continental Illinois National Bank, Harris Trust and Savings Bank, Irving Trust, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co, Marine Midland, and Security Pacific National Bank. Other banking companies announcing prime rate rises included Pittsburgh National Bank, Texas Commerce Bank-Houston, Provident National Bank, First National Bank of Boston, Florida Federal Savings and Loan Association, and SunTrust Banks.

OKLAHOMA WEEKLY CROP REPORT The Oklahoma weekly USDA crop report said cold weather slowed crop development and caused some cattle deaths. Wheat growth was halted by cold weather, and rain early in the week prevented fertilizer application and weed spraying. Fields in the west were short of nitrogen, and moderate insect activity was noted in the southwest region. Wheat condition was rated 15 pct fair, 84 pct good and one pct excellent. Row crop activity was very slow amid wet conditions. Topsoil moisture was rated 30 pct adequate and 70 pct surplus, and subsoil moisture was rated 100 pct adequate. Only two days were suitable for fieldwork.  
CHINA TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 1987 China's grain imports will rise in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand, but will be not be as large as in the past, Chinese officials and Japanese traders told Reuters. They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy would not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peaked at 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982. An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73 mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985. Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor harvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports, which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985. "China is short of foreign exchange," the Shanghai official said. "We cannot rely on imports, even at current low world prices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become a major importer." A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought, low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and animal consumption. "At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grain it exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badly needs," the trader said. The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reduce the summer grain harvest from last year's level. The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying enough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making it difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln tonnes against 391 mln in 1986. "All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest area, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and high-yield cash crops," it said. It added factory production might have to be reduced to provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight the drought. Since January, the press has devoted much attention to grain, stressing that growth in output is vital to China's economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low. Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain production is a key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output. The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise agriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the 70,000 workers available to help farmers. Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outside Shanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits. Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department of Zhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grain output in his province. "In addition, we are setting up grain production bases, raising the level of science and technology on the farms and improving the supply of raw materials, roads and other infrastructure," he said. The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their spare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases, they lease the land to grain farmers. The China Daily said last month that grain output should reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480 and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made profitable. "The advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption. Only this will boost enthusiasm," it said.  
HOLDER PROPOSES UNITEL &lt;UNV> SALE OR LIQUIDATION Michael Landes, a major stockholder in Unitel Video Inc, said he has asked the company to consider liquidating, or selling some or all of its assets. "Mr. Landes has requested the company to implement a program to maximize shareholder values, which might include a sale of all or part of the company or a liquidation," he said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Landes and another Unitel Video investor, Albert Schwatz, have formed a shareholder group and together hold 329,225 common shares, or 15.2 pct of the total outstanding common stock. Landes and Schwartz had reached an agreement in principle with the New York video tape service company on a 12.50 dlr a share takeover proposal last September, but subsequent merger talks broke down in October. The investors told the SEC they are continuing to review their positions company and may acquire more shares or sell some or all of their current stake.  
AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS American Express Co, rumored to be considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet broadening international competition. In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said the actions under consideration are an integral part of American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and that the two companies have been having both internal and external discussions on the matters. American Express said no decision has been reached on the strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately decide to follow growth plans already in place. Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of the profitable brokerage firm to the public. There was some speculation that American Express had also considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was considered highly unlikely, analysts said. American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it to a Friday close at 74. It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a similar statement was being circulated to employees. Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50 pct in the last year. Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm. Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express' 1.25 billion dlr net in 1986. American Express' ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs. To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling. "(American) Express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to," said Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities. Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president. The reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company. Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition. Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F. Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major Wall Street brokerage.  
SPAIN RAISES CALL MONEY RATES ON HIGHER DEMAND The Bank of Spain raised overnight call money rates by 1/4 to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas in today's auction, which a bank spokesman termed "heavy." Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising demands for funds, the spokesman said. He said in reply to Reuters inquiries that rates could rise further if money supply growth rose above this year's eight pct target for M-4, defined as liquid assets in public hands. Money supply rose at an annualised rate of 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January. Growth was 11.4 pct in 1986. A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applying a more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation. The consumer price index rose 8.3 pct last year. "Money supply control is the government's chief weapon against inflation," he said. "The problem is higher rates are attracting liquidity from abroad." He said this was why the central bank enacted specific measures to control the inflow of foreign capital. The Bank of Spain earlier this month imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks to curb short-term speculative capital from abroad.  
BRAZIL SAYS DEBT CRISIS IS WORLD PROBLEM Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said his country's foreign debt crisis could only be solved by changes in the international financial system. Speaking to a business conference he said "It is not Brazil that has to make adjustments with the IMF (International Monetary Fund). It is the international financial community that is taking away resources from the developing countries." "The crisis is not in Brazil, a country that has had the third biggest trade surplus ...In the past two years Brazil had remitted 24 billion dlrs in debt servicing and received only two billion in fresh funds," he added. Funaro said that during his recent trip to the U.S., Europe and Japan to explain Brazil's decision last month to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt, he stressed the country's commitment to growth. "We need to and will make the effort (to solve the debt problem) but we cannot make an effort that means we stop growing," he said, adding that political and not purely commercial solutions were needed to the debt crisis. Brazil, whose 108 billion dlr foreign debt is the largest in the developing world, has been under pressure from official and private creditors to work out an economic adjustment program with the IMF to combat rocketing inflation and foreign payments problems. President Jose Sarney's government has repeatedly refused to approach the Fund, arguing that an IMF programme would lead to recession. Funaro said that in his talks with creditors he had tried to restore credibility in the country in the hope of finding a lasting solution to the debt problem. "We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be one of continuous crisis." To sustain internal growth Brazil would have to import more machinery and equipment this year and export fewer raw materials. The country was thus targetting a fall in this year's trade surplus to 8.0 billion dlrs from 1986's 9.5 billion. Domestically, Funaro said economies had led to a reduction in the public sector deficit to 2.7 pct of gross domestic product in 1986, the lowest for many years and that this should fall to 1.5 pct this year.  
SWEDISH GNP ROSE LESS THAN EXPECTED, FIGURES SHOW Sweden's Gross National Product rose 1.3 pct last year against 2.3 pct in 1985, mainly due to a lower than forecast growth in exports and a sharp fall in total investments, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported. Private consumption rose 4.1 pct during 1986 against 2.7 pct in 1985 whereas the Finance Ministry had expected an increase of only 3.6 pct. Total investments fell 0.7 pct against a rise of 6.3 pct in 1985. The Finance Ministry had forecast a rise of 0.3 pct in 1986. Exports rose 2.1 pct last year against 2.3 pct in 1985, but the Finance Ministry had predicted a growth of 2.8 pct.  
BUNDESBANK BUYS DOLLARS IN FRANKFURT - DEALERS The Bundesbank bought large amounts of dollars for yen in an apparent attempt to hold the dollar above 149 yen, dealers said. The dollar intervention was in concert with some other central banks, they said. Dealers said the Bank of Japan and Bank of England supported the dollar against the yen earlier today and that these two banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve were also active yesterday. The Bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers' remarks. Dealers said the intervention underlined the determination of central banks to keep currencies within recent ranges following last month's agreement in Paris by six leading countries to foster currency stability. One dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with the Bundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buy dollars after the Japanese and U.K. Central bank moves. He said the Bundesbank told him it was observing the situation to see if it should intervene in consultation with other central banks. Since the Paris agreement on February 22 the dollar had until yesterday traded in a 1.8150-1.8700 mark range, and above 150 yen, with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to test central banks' resolve to defend currency stability. But the test came this week with the dollar falling below 1.81 marks and 150 yen. Dealers said a reviving trade dispute between Washington and Tokyo and growing sentiment that the dollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate U.S. Trade deficit were behind the weakness. This week's intervention showed central banks were prepared to cooperate to defend the Paris pact, dealers said. Dealers said it was significant the West German and British central banks were supporting the dollar against the yen. That showed the pact involved multilateral cooperation by central banks to foster currency stability, they said. But it was unclear how such cooperation was being arranged and how frequent consultations between central banks were.  
ROSPATCH &lt;RPCH> TO RESPOND TO DIAGNOSTIC &lt;DRS> Rospatch Corp said it will have a news release later in response to today's acquisition bid by Diagnostic Retrieval Systems Inc for 22 dlrs a share. Rospatch earlier requested its stock be halted in over the counter trading, last trade 24-1/8. Diagnostic said its bid was for a total 53 mln dlrs through a cash tender offer for all, but not less than 51 pct of Rosptach outstanding common. For its fourth-quarter ended December 31, 1986, Rospatch reported net loss 2,649,000 or 1.10 dlrs a share compared a loss of 627,500 or 35 cts profit for the 1985 period. In December the Brookehill Group in New York said it had 9.7 pct stake. J.A. Parini, Rospatch chief executive, responded on January eight by saying the investment was a vote in confidence in the company.  
GPU &lt;GPU> SEES TMI-2 FUEL PROBLEMS RESOLVED General Public Utilities Corp said the water-clarity problem delaying the removal of fuel from the damaged Unit Two of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant appears to have been resolved. The company said the slower than expected removal of the fuel, which has been primarily due to the water-clarity problems, is now expected to extend fuel removal into 1988. A spokesman said the company had previously expected this to be completed by the end of 1987 and has not estimated how far into 1988 the process will extend. It still expects to complete the entire clean-up by the end of 1988, he added. GPU said its auditors, Coopers and Lybrand, again qualified its opinion of GPU's financial statements, adding the recovery of TMI-2 decommissioning costs to the unresolved issues leading to the qualified opinion. GPU said its operating subsidiaries will seek to recover the costs of decommissioning TMI-2 in future rate proceedings. As in past years, the qualified opinion continues to list other uncertainties associated with the accident, which damaged TMI-2 -- the recovery of cleanup costs and any payments for damages that might exceed available insurance proceeds.

TODD SHIPYARDS &lt;TOD> OMITS COMMMON DIVIDEND Todd Shipyards Corp said it omitted payment of the quarterly dividend on its common stock and lowered the dividend on its series A preferred stock to 75 cts from 77 cts a share. Todd said the 75 ct preferred dividend will be paid May one to shareholders of record April 15. The company said it omitted the common dividend to cover both losses from a commercial ship conversion contract and increased reserves for previously announced discontinued shipyard operations. In addition, the company said its lenders agreed to temporarily reduce the net worth requirement of its revolving credit and term-loan pact to 140 mln dlrs from 130 mln. The reduction will hold through May 15, it said. Todd said the reduction in the net worth requirement allowed for the payment of the preferred dividend and prevented it from violating covenants of its credit agreement. The company said it is also negotiating with its lenders to extend the reduced net worth terms beyond May 15. Todd added that it has suffered financially because of the U.S. Navy's unwillingness to release certain retentions under completed ship construction contracts and a general decrease in U.S. military spending.

SOUTH KOREA TO MAINTAIN TRADE SURPLUS 3-5 YEARS South Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt. He said in an interview with Reuters that after a few years it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods and move toward a more balanced trade position. He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a trade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 900 mln dlrs. Asked if South Korea would drop its trade barriers once its foreign debt was substantially reduced, he said "yes, I think so." Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products valued at 1.8 billion dlrs. About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of the type South Korea normally bought from Japan. Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian officials and businessmen. He said in the interview the U.S. purchases were to reduce his country's 7.1 billion dlr surplus with the United States and also to cut its 5.6 billion dlr shortfall with Japan. Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buy U.S. goods than Japanese goods. He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he hoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to resolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation. Rha said "I hope the leaders can get together to find a solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions." But he added "the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions because of domestic political reasons." Speaking of his own country, he said "We have made a lot of concessions already." He cited regulations permitting foreign investment in industrial firms, allowing increased foreign banking activity and cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by strengthening protection of copyrights and patents. Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs. Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said "at this moment, we have no thought of retaliation." South Korea is a major exporter to the United States of textiles and apparel and electronic goods, such as television sets, video cassette records and personal computers. Its puchases from the United States include electronic testing equipment and grains and cotton. The trade mission's purchases here included three Boeing passenger planes for 400 mln dlrs, four McDonnell Douglas planes for 300 mln dlrs; and machinery worth 725 mln dlrs.

Pieter van der Vorm, managing director of Graan Elevator Mij (GEM), which handles 95 pct of grain passing through the port, said their main Europoort terminal was out of action because of a strike by technical staff. The actions, in support of union demands in negotiations over a new labour agreement, began on Wednesday when grain handlers stopped work. Van der Vorm said that if strikes continued on today's scale for some time vessels coming to unload grain in Rotterdam would face delays, but this was not happening yet. Wednesday's actions left GEM's facilities 40 pct operational, and there were only limited strikes yesterday. Talks between unions and employers yesterday and today produced no result, but FNV spokesman Bert Duim said the union was prepared to put their key demand, for a 36 hour working week, at the bottom of the agenda. Van der Vorm said, however, the union's demands on a range of issues were far in excess of the management's final offer.  
JAPAN ASKS BANKS TO CUT DOLLAR SALES - DEALERS The Finance Ministry has asked Japanese commercial banks to moderate their dollar sales, bank dealers said. They said the Ministry had telephoned city and long-term banks earlier this week to make the request. One dealer said this was the first time the Ministry had made such a request to commercial banks. Finance Ministry officials were unavailable for immediate comment. Dealers said the Ministry has already asked institutional investors to reduce their sales of the dollar.

HARCOURT &lt;HBJ> DISAPPOINTED WITH HARPER &lt;HPR> Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc said it is disappointed that no negotiations with Harper and Row Publishers Inc are underway. Harcourt made a 50 dlrs a share unsolicited bid on March 11. On March 17, Harcourt said three of its officers met with Harper's financial advisor but has had no discussions since then. Harcourt said it does not plan to increase its bid. Harcourt's bid was preceded by an earlier 34 dlrs a share bid by Theodore Cross. Harper had no response to Harcourt's announcement. Earlier today, Harper said a recently appointed special committee of independent directors had received expressions of interest from several domestic and foreign firms with respect to restructuring or acquisition transactions. Harper said no determination had been made as to any transaction and that its special committee is continuing in talks with interested parties in an effort to come to a conclusion in the near future.  
U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN HELP, OFFERED FACILITIES The Bank of England said it had given the money market 206 mln stg of assistance this afternoon and offered the discount houses borrowing facilities to take out the rest of the 1.10 billion stg shortage, revised down from an initial 1.15 billion estimate. It made no alteration to its established dealing rates, buying 95 mln stg of band one bank bills at 10-7/8 pct and 111 mln of band two bank bills at 10-13/16 pct. This brings the Bank's total assistance so far today to 243 mln stg.  
BANGLADESH MONEY SUPPLY RISES IN DECEMBER Bangladesh's broad-based M2 money supply rose 6.95 pct to 132.79 billion taka in December after rising 0.51 pct to 124.16 billion in November and 3.07 pct to 114.22 billion in December 1985, the Central Bank said. On a year on year basis, M2 rose 16.25 pct in the 12 months to December, 12.04 pct to November and 16 pct to December 1985. Narrowly-based M1 rose 9.55 pct to 50 billion taka against a fall of 0.45 pct to 45.64 billion in November and a 3.03 pct rise to 45.51 billion to December 1985, it added. Year on year, M1 rose 9.86 pct in December.  
TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS COOPERATION WORKING Treasury Secretary James Baker said that the agreement in Paris to cooperate in exchange rate changes showed that the process of coordination agreed to at the Tokyo summit was working. He told the House Appropriations Committee the meeting "demonstrated that the process is working." He noted that the industrial surplus countries committed themselves to strengthen their growth prospects while the deficit countries agreed to reduce their domestic imbalances.  Baker said that for its part, Japan announced a cut in its discount rate to 2.5 pct and committed itself to prepare a comprehensive economic program to stimulate domestic demand after the Diet completes action on the current budget. He said the United States must also do its share pressing for reductions in the federal budget deficit through spending cuts. "And we must continue to oppose protectionist pressures," he added.  
BENEFICIAL &lt;BNL> UNIT SALE APPROVED Beneficial Corp said the sale of its American Centennial Insurance Co subsidiary to &lt;First Delaware Holdings Inc> was approved by the Delaware Insurance Department. Under the transaction, American Centennial will receive a cash infusion of 200 mln dlrs, including the settlement of tax sharing agreements with Beneficial Corp, Beneficial said. It will also receive 25 mln dlrs from Beneficial International Insurance Co, another Beneficial subsidiary being purchased by the management-led group of First Delaware, the company said.  
ECUADOR DEPUTY MINISTER SEEKS OIL AID IN VENEZUELA Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on further Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industry following last week's earthquake, officials said. Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports. Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after 180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs. The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota, set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987. "All options are open at this moment in the context of cooperation on oil production," a Venezuelan energy and mines ministry source said. Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the pipeline is repaired, officials said. Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at technical level, officials said. Industry sources said that among the options are for Venezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota, or for Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply Ecuador's Far Eastern clients. But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been reached on the matter, and that an announcement would be made in due course. Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired. Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake.  
ALUMINIUM SCRAP RECOVERY AND USAGE TO RISE Aluminium scrap recovery and usage and output of secondary metal will continue to rise, said Shearson Lehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium market which details cost and demand factors. Although primary smelting costs have declined generally in recent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offered by secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted material increasingly attractive. It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity to produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around 550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said. On the demand side, developments in automobiles and packaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption. Automobile production, although expected to fall this year, is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castings is gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry, particularly in the U.S. In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium to dominate the beverage can market in any of the other major economies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there is evidence recycling is on the increase in other countries. In addition to the cost savings involved, technology advances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced by the secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said. There is not likely to be a problem of availability as the U.S. Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true of several European countries, albeit on a smaller scale.  
KODAK &lt;EK> TO CUT POLYESTER FIBER OPERATIONS Eastman Kodak Co said it will reduce capacity and employment levels in two polyester fiber operations of its Eastman Chemicals division. A company spokesman said the company will take "some writeoff" in connection with the action in the first quarter and there will probably be a further "carryover" writeoff in the second quarter.  The writeoffs will cover the costs of plants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connected with the staff cuts. Kodak said the division will discontinue production of polyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at its Carolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100 mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity, mostly in Columbia. The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in Columbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers, and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in Kingsport, Tenn. Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan for employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical Products Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten Defense Corp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be completed by April 30. Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance have led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POY production will be shut down as a result of its exit from the business. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman since last year. The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel polyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from 500 mln due to lesser demand. It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase in a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman. Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsport units affected about 10,800. The company spokesman later said the charges will be insignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates.

ANALYSTS SEE SLOW MOVE TO HIGHER U.S. PRIME RATE Quarter-point prime rate increases to 7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of the Federal Reserve's policy intentions, economists said. "Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and the prime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, but no rush is likely," said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co. Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by Chase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher. McCulley said that once the spread between three-month certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than 1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime rate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently. However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near term, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to follow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example, the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount rate increase in April of that year. Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since last August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct shortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to the current 5-1/2 pct level on August 20. "The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2 pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct," said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co. Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's meeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may well foster higher interest rates soon. Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy change today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate pressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery. "The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to tighten policy when they did today's coupon pass," said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co. In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for its own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a "pass." "The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy change," said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and the prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153 basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate increase. The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise "may have been less a response to interest rates than an attempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line." Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to developing countries, large money center banks with heavy exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans. The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime rate and also how quickly they move. In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of funds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly 6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds. The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five and 6-3/4 pct. Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the 6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there, banks may not quickly boost their prime rates. But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to help the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.  
WOOLWORTH BIDS 244 MLN STG FOR SUPERDRUG Woolworth Holdings Plc &lt;WLUK.L> said it would make a 244 mln stg agreed bid for &lt;Superdrug Stores Plc> valuing the company's shares at about 696p each. The offer would be made on the basis of 17 new Woolworth ordinary shares for every 20 in Superdrug. Woolworth said it had received acceptances from the holders of 61 pct of Superdrug shares. The bid is Woolworth's second attempt in recent months to acquire a retail chemist chain. Earlier this year it negotiated a possible bid for &lt;Underwoods Plc> buit the talks were broken off two weeks ago. Full acceptance of the offer would involve the issue of about 29.8 mln new Woolworth shares, or 14 pct of the enlarged share capital. A cash alternative would offer 646p for each share in Superdrug. Members of the Goldstein family have accepted the offer for 11.7 mln shares, which have not been underwritten. Another major shareholder, Rite Aid Corp's Rite Investments Corp unit, had accepted the offer for 9.9 mln shares, and would take the cash alternative for 9.0 mln of these. In the year to end-January, Woolworth reported pretax profits sharply higher at 115.3 mln stg after 81.3 mln previously. In the year to end-February, Superdrug reported pretax profits of 12.26 mln after 10.36 mln previously on turnover that rose to 202.9 mln from 164.3 mln. Superdrug shares firmed to 670p from 480p on Friday. Woolworth eased to 813p from 830p.

BROADER U.S. EEP SOUGHT BY REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS Republican members of the House Agriculture Committee said they will propose amendments tomorrow to a pending trade bill increasing funding for the export enhancement program, EEP, and significantly expanding the scope of the program. At a press conference, Republican lawmakers said they would propose expanding EEP to include all countries "willing to purchase additional commodities at reasonable prices." In addition, the Congressmen said they would propose extending the life of EEP to five years from the current three years and increasing the EEP funding ceiling to 2.5 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion at present. The Agriculture committee tomorrow will begin drafting amendments to an omnibus trade bill now before the House. Responding to the Republican plan, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said they favor a flexible, targeted use of EEP instead of an across-the-board program which they termed too costly. The Republican Congressmen also said they will offer an amendment to the trade bill instructing the U.S. Agriculture Department to value the bonus commodities used for EEP at the market value, rather than the cost of acquisition. But Lyng said USDA already plans to change to market value accounting rather than acquisition value, in order to avoid hitting a funding ceiling for eep of 1.5 billion dlrs. Lyng said under market value accounting only about 700 mln dlrs of EEP commodities have been used to date. Using acquisition value, USDA officials said the value is higher.

IRAN SAYS IT INTENDS NO THREAT TO GULF SHIPPING Iran said reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless, and warned the U.S. And other countries not to interfere in the region. Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by "a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world." U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf. The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf. U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship "Silkworm" missiles, which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before. The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were "misleading propaganda." He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use "all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension." Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. "We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway." "We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area," he said. Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were not unusual. A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea. The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying the U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in the region.  
U.S. GOLD EAGLE SALES PROJECTED AT 3.1 MLN OUNCES American Eagle gold bullion coin sales are projected at 3.1 mln troy ounces in their first year on the market, well above the target of 2.2 mln, Donna Pope, director of the U.S. Mint, told journalists. World sales, which began on October 20, 1986, reached 2.193 mln ounces in less than six months of sales. This made it world market leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, Pope said. Pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all gold Eagle sales were within North America, roughly 40 pct were in Europe and about eight pct in Asia. She said despite introduction of several new gold bullion coins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preserve the Eagle's strong market share with extensive publicity. The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins, as long as this is available at market prices. The remaining gold is taken either from U.S. Treasury stocks, or from the open market, Pope said. Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition here from the Canadian Maple Leaf, and also to a lesser extent from the South African Krugerrand. Some estimated the Maple Leaf's West German market share at 60 pct. The figures may be distorted, as many German investors buy gold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pct value-added tax imposed here. Including the tax, the one-ounce coins traded today at 906 marks, they said. Competition may also come from new gold coins, including Belgium's ECU, which began sales today. Britain and Australia also have plans to mint gold bullion coins, the analysts said.

DLR FALLS ON FEAR TOKYO WON'T HIKE DEMAND-MIYAZAWA Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that the dollar's drop today to 145 yen is partly attributable to the perception inside and outside Japan that the country has failed to fulfill its promise to expand domestic demand. He told a Lower House budget committee in Parliament that it was natural for other nations to think that Japan is not doing enough because of the delay in the passage of the 1987/88 budget. The budget has been delayed by opposition boycotts of Parliament to protest government plans for a new sales tax.

YEUTTER PLANS TRADE TRIP TO CHINA THIS SUMMER U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss trade issues including China's admission to the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China could be a member of GATT before the end of the year. "They are making major moves to becoming a full scale member of the world economy," he told the House Appropriations subcommittee which oversees his agency's budget. Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of China's GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the final touches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip. The admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade, would offer both potential export markets and potential competition for U.S. industries, he said. "That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S. business," Yeutter said. "I think China will develop into a fine market for us," he added.  
U.S. OFFICIAL TO VISIT JAPAN AS TRADE ROW GROWS Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost will visit Tokyo next week for meetings with high-level officials that will include talks on the growing trade row over Japanese semiconductor electronics products. He is the first high-level U.S. official to visit Japan since President Reagan announced last week plans to impose tariffs worth up to 30 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods on April 17 in retaliation for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up to a pact on microchip trade signed last September. Deputy State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the trip is set for April 6 to 8. U.S.-Japanese talks of this kind are regularly held each year at this time, she told reporters. The Armacost discussions with Deputy Foreign Minister Ryohei Murata and other senior Japanese officials will focus on U.S.-Japanese foreign aid programs and political security issues of mutual concern, she added. "Although an exchange of views on bilateral relations is expected, the talks are not directly related to U.S.-Japanese trade relations," she insisted. But, in response to questions, Oakley acknowledged that trade will be discussed. Japan's 58.6 billion dlrs trade surplus with the United States last year has come under fire in Congress, which is concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. Trade deficit in 1986.  
NATO HOLDS EMERGENCY MEETING ON AEGEAN CRISIS NATO ambassadors met in emergency session today to discuss tension between members Greece and Turkey over a disputed area of the Aegean Sea on the Western Alliance's southern flank, Greek diplomatic sources said. They said no information had yet emerged from the meeting, called after statements from both countries that they were prepared to back rival oil exploration teams with warships. General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff, said today the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning. Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said "The military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions." The row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Emery said it would sell or lease Purolator's air hub in Indianapolis, Ind., which is currently under construction, and would divest Purolator's Stant Inc subsidiary. No indications of interest for the assets have been received so far, Emery said. Emery said it would operate Purolator as a subsidiary if it succeeded in the takever, but would integrate its air hub. It said it plans to finance its stock purchases with borrowings from Chemical Bank, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York, Bankers Trust Co and Salomon Brothers Holding Co Inc, the parent of Salmon Brothers Inc, Emery's financial advisor. Emery said it already has a commitment letter from its banks for up to 129.9 mln dlrs for the stock purchases. An unspecified amount of internally generated funds would also be used for the stock purchases, it added.  
MARCOR &lt;MAAR> EXPECTS FISCAL YEAR PROFIT MarCor Development Co Inc said it expects to post a profit for its fiscal year ended February 28 of about two mln dlrs, compared to a year earlier loss of 3.2 mln dlrs.

During March last year privately-held Marcor acquired a controlling interest in F and M Importing, divested the food business, renamed the company and began operating as a real estate investment and service company.  
GERMAN PUBLIC AUTHORITY BUNDESBANK HOLDINGS FALL The net position of federal states worsened in the first March week, cutting public authority net holdings at the Bundesbank by 500 mln marks, the central bank said. States' cash deposits at the central bank fell to 800 mln and they also drew down 1.2 billion marks in book credit, 900 mln marks more than in the prior week. By contrast, however, the federal government was able to reduce its credit drawdown at the central bank by 900 mln marks to 900 mln. Despite the stronger states' net needs in the week, their cash position and other market dependent influences just about balanced the outflow of liquidity from the money market through an increase in cash in circulation, the Bundesbank said. Cash in circulation rose by 1.4 billion marks in the week to 122.9 billion. Liquidity also came in through the maturing of short-term treasury bills bought from the Bundesbank in the prior week. Gross currency reserves rose in the week by 400 mln marks to 109.9 billion. Foreign liabilities of the Bundesbank were largely unchanged at 22.8 billion marks, giving a rise in net currency reserves of 400 mln to 87.0 billion, it said. The Bundesbank said its balance sheet total fell by 3.77 billion in the week to 218.45 billion.

AUSTRALIAN TUG CREWS DELAY FOREIGN CONTAINER SHIPS Tug crews are preventing the movement of foreign-flag container vessels in and out of the ports of Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle, shipping sources said. They said maritime unions imposed bans on late Wednesday for reasons that are obscure but seem to be linked with claims for a pay rise above the 10 dlrs a week awarded by the Arbitration Commission nationally to all workers recently. Only about 10 vessels are being delayed but the bans will affect container terminal movements and will disrupt liner schedules, they said. The dispute goes to the Commission on Monday, they said.  
BUSINESS EDITOR OFFERS 34 DLRS FOR HARPER &lt;HPR> Theodore Cross, editor of Business and Society Review, a business publication, said an investor group he heads has offered to buy Harper and Row Publishers Inc for 34 dlrs a share cash.

Cross, whose investor group includes his wife, Mary, said they already hold 261,650 Harper and Row common shares, or 6.0 pct of the total outstanding common stock. They said they have spent 3.5 mln dlrs on their stake so far. Cross said he proposed in a letter to Harper and Row that the company be merged into a company Cross is forming. Suggesting that the total cost of completing the merger would be 190 mln dlrs, Cross said he would use 20 mln dlrs of his own money for the deal and up to 170 mln dlrs which would be borrowed from the First National Bank of Boston under a revolving credit facility the bank has agreed to provide.

The board's review is continuing with the company's independent legal and financial advisers, American Motors said in a statement issued from New York. American Motors' board voted to postpone its annual shareholders meeting scheduled for April 29 in Southfield, Michigan. The next regularly scheduled meeting of American Motors board will be April 29, although it is expected that directors will meet again prior to that date, according to the statement. Early last week, Chrysler said it agreed to buy the 46.1 pct interest owned by Regie Nationale des Usines Renault in American Motors and acquire the balance of American Motors in a transaction valued at 1.11 billion dlrs. Later that week, AMC said it had retained financial and legal advisers and expected to meet periodiocally over the next several weeks to consider the proposal.

U.S. ASKS JAPAN END AGRICULTURE IMPORT CONTROLS The U.S. Wants Japan to eliminate import controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis told Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), a spokesman for Keidanren said. The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by Congress. Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito. Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S. Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country. He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three, the spokesman said. Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S. Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy.

ICI &lt;ICI> SEEKS GAINS IN SPECIALTY BUSINESSES Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, the largest chemical company in the United Kingdom, will expand its specialty chemicals and drug businesses this year, and better its 1986 results, said chairman-elect Denys Henderson. "We expect to shift our company toward higher value-added businesses and continue to broaden our base," Henderson told reporters at an informal meeting here. ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S. drug company, ICI Pharma, which, with its Stuart Pharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its current pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990. Henderson said, "Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in the way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not." ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug maker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales were about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs, which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits. He estimated that by 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical division would account for about 30 pct of total company profits. "The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate of return," said A.W. Clements, finance director of ICI, who was also at the meeting. Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs to doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one. Henderson said the major new products in the company's pipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs annually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications, Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin, a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure. Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensing agreements with Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK>, is not expected until about 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin in the U.S. later this year. Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986 income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15 billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much. Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by Glidden Paints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a unit of Hanson Industries Inc. Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs available for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40 acquisitions, the largest being Glidden. He said that more acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as "too expensive." Henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effective April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones who will retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.

STUDY GROUP URGES INCREASED U.S. OIL RESERVES A study group said the United States should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry. U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750 mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise. The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private group, also called for new research for oil exploration and development techniques. It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption. The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation: to protect the U.S. industry through an import fee or other such device or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil. But the group did not strongly back either option, saying there were benefits and drawbacks to both. It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports.

MEXICO'S RESERVES REACH EIGHT BILLION DLRS Additional capital inflows of 1.5 billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico's reserves to about eight billion dlrs, director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters. Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved investor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has forced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflows totalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986. Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the sake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of funds available for badly needed investment. Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is drawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or five months, Gurria noted. Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on the commercial banks' 1.2 billion dlr investment-support contingency facility. That money will be available until April 1988 if Mexico's export receipts and the price of oil fall below certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said today, "We expect we'll never have to use it." Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on the second contingency facility included in the bank financing package - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World Bank. Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the development of exports of manufactured goods. He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billion dlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil and export promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month. Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its International Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days based on a successful review of end-1986 economic results. Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages of discussions which will determine quantitative economic targets for 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMF for the rest of 1987. Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eight bilateral accords with government creditors within the Paris Club. Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrella agreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrs of official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalize pacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks. In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, he said all countries from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development have continued to provide export credit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring.

TAIWAN PLANS NEW TARIFF CUTS Taiwan plans another round of deep tariff cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S., A senior economic planner said. Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second half of this year. Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and Wang said further cuts would go much deeper. "We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially," he said. The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as too selective. Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism. Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas, particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are among the island's main export-earners. A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of Taiwan textiles. Under the accord, Taiwan's textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given more generous terms.

TAIWAN ISSUES MORE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT Taiwan's central bank issued 12 billion Taiwan dlrs worth of certificates of deposit after issuing six billion yesterday, bringing CD issues so far this year to 115.47 billion dlrs, a bank official told Reuters. The new CDs have maturities of six months, one year and two years and bear interest rates ranging from 4.07 pct to 5.12 pct, he said. The issues are aimed at helping curb the growth of M-1b money supply, which is the result of large foreign exchange reserves. The reserves now total more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs.

SUNTER BEGINS TENDER FOR ALLEGHENY &lt;AG> Allegheny International Inc said Sunter Acquisititon Corp, formed by First Boston Inc, began a cash tender offer in accordance with their previously announced merger agreement for all the outsanding shares of Allegheny's common stock, 2.19 dlr cumulative preference stock and 11.25 dlrs convertible preferred stock. The offer expires April 9, unless extended. Under terms of the agreement, tendering shareholders will receive 24.60 dlrs per common share, 20 dlrs per preference share and 87.50 dlrs per preferred share. Allegheny said the offer is conditioned upon the valid tender of stock representing a majority of the voting power and at least two-thirds of outstanding shares of preference stock and preferred stock. The merger agreement was announced earlier this week.  
BOLIVIA TO OFFER TO BUY BACK BANK DEBT Bolivia is to make a formal offer during the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bank president Jier Nogales said. Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steering committee of Bolivia's creditor banks had agreed to consider the offer at a meeting in New York last month. He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivian paper on the international secondary debt market, where it now trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value. Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy back its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the discounted rate in full. Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to 30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the international markets, he added. Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans to commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said there would be no money available to restart traditional debt servicing to them for some time. Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes to cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs, but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at discounted rates. Nogales said practical and strategic considerations would determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in the next few months. He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over the price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would make a single non-negotiable offer. He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly creditor countries, let alone commercial banks. The only traditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which would mean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater loss provisions, he added. "We are confident that the banks are going to be reasonable," Nogales said. "Now they can resolve their problems for once and for all." "The most conservative ones who want a little more will wait a year, but I don't know if the window of opportunity will be open all the time," he added. Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia's four billion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed to governments and the rest to international agencies, Nogales said negotiators had achieved considerable success in recent discussions with the Paris Club. He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to reschedule Bolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, while accepting that interest would not be paid until 1989. Interest rates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris Club rules, he added. He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard penalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with Argentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt. He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from international agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year. The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed from a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs last year, he added. Nogales said that Bolivia's net international reserves now stood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs in disposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro took office in August, 1985. Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct a year in the government's first month in office, was now down to 10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and the plan was that it should continue at this level. He said the government was also expecting at least three pct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative rates.  
WALL STREET STOCKS/ANACOMP INC &lt;AAC> Anacomp Inc, one of the most actively traded NYSE issues, rose today as at least one analyst expected earnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of a micrographics company. Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after trading as high as seven earlier. Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD>. "The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX," Harlow said. "Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will integrate the company in the second half." Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said. A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986. Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for DatagraphiX. "The estimates on the street narrow it down to between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs," Harlow added. Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct a share. In Anacomp's fiscal 1986 it earned 4,073,000 dlrs or 13 cts a share. Whale Securities recommends buying the stock, Harlow said.  
HAWKER SIDDELEY CANADA TO SELL UNIT &lt;Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc> said that, due to poor market conditions for railway freight car manufacturing, it plans to sell its Trenton Works division in Trenton, Nova Scotia. Hawker Siddeley said it set aside a provision of 7.7 mln dlrs for the proposed sale. It also said lower 1986 earnings were due to much lower earnings in transportation equipment and losses in steel castings and forgings, which offset gains in the mining sector and improvements in forestry equipment. Hawker Siddeley also said demand for new railway equipment was limited with export sales frequently restrained by customers' financing difficulties. Demand for steel castings and wheels for Canadian railways continued to be very depressed with maintenance requirements at the lowest level in the past decade. However, there was demand for industrial casting due to increased hydro-electric power generation, the company said. The company said manufacturing of mining machinery and tunnelling equipment showed greatly improved results in the U.S. and export markets, mainly China and India. The Orenda division maintained a high level of activity in aircraft engine repair and overhaul and in the manufacture of engine components. Sawmill equipment and skidder operations were affected by a strike in British Columbia and the extended debate on U.S. imports of Canadian lumber, but there were encouraging signs at yearend, the company said.  
VENEZUELA TO ANNOUCE PARTNER FOR COAL VENTURE Petroleos de Venezuela S.A will announce within two weeks the name of a foreign consortium it has chosen to help exploit the coal deposits at Guasare in western Zulia state, PDVSA president Juan Chacin Guzman said. Chacin told reporters the foreign partner will provide capital as well as technical and marketing expertise to the Carbozulia project, which the state oil company will manage. PDVSA officials said that among those who bid for the partnership is a consortium between Agip Carbone, a subsidiary of Italy's Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI), and Atlantic Richfield &lt;ARC> of the United States. Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said discussions are currently taking place to finalize the terms of the contract with the foreign partner. PDVSA vice-president Pablo Reimpell said last week the first shipment of coal from the Carbozulia project should be made during the final quarter of 1987, and would measure between 100-150,000 metric tons. Plans call for production to eventually reach 500,000 mt annually. Reimpell said the original investment in the project will be approximately 8 billion bolivars.  
NEW DUTCH SPECIAL ADVANCES UNCHANGED AT 5.3 PCT The Dutch central bank announced new 12-day special advances at an unchanged rate of 5.3 pct to cover money market tightness for the period April 3 to 15.

Until the end of last week, the central was holding out staunchly against market pressures for lower rates in an apparent effort to preserve the expected rate cuts for around the time of the government's annual Budget on March 17. Sterling remained firm around 1.59 dlrs compared with its close here on Friday at 1.5865 dlrs.  
MORGAN GRENFELL SAYS 1986 PROFITS HIT BY GUINNESS &lt;Morgan Grenfell Group Plc> said its 1986 pre-tax profits were lower than forecast because of depreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc &lt;GUIN.L> shares and because of securities trading losses in the U.S. Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group's seven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3.5 mln dlr loss on its risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some eight mln stg to 82.2 mln. He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal approaches about a takeover of the group but was not interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not elaborate. Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during the brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc &lt;DIST.L> in the first half of last year. The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price during the bid. Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness affair. Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier, resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider information. He currently faces criminal charges. Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been "one of the most traumatic in our history," but that clients and staff had been supportive. "I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet." Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from corporate finance activities and progress in asset management. Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the performance of the group so far in 1987 was "within reasonable touch of the budget." Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as interim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a new chief executive within a few months. He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of 562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but declined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going on to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said. Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p, 9p down on yesterday's 375p. REUTER...

WILLIAMS &lt;WMB> HAS 4TH QTR CHARGE Williams Cos said a fourth quarter charge of 250 mln dlrs from discontinued operations and writedowns contributed to a 1986 net loss of 240 mln dlrs or 6.97 dlrs a share against earnings of 31.6 mln dlrs or 92 cts in 1985. The loss in the quarter was 232.3 mln dlrs or 6.75 dlrs against income of 10.7 mln dlrs or 31 cts a year ago. Revenues in the quarter fell to 521.1 mln dlrs from 716.9 mln and in the year fell to 1.9 billion dlrs from 2.5 billion in 1985. Williams also said the previously announced sale of its Agrico Chemical Co unit to Freeport-Mcmoran Resource Partners Ltd has cleared antitrust review and should close next week. The 1987 first quarter will include proceeds from the Agrico sale, for 250 mln dlrs cash at closing plus deferred payments, and proceeds of 320 mln dlrs from the sale of a stake in Peabody Holding Co, completed in January. In the 1986 first quarter, Williams reported net of 14.2 mln dlrs or 41 cts a share on sales of 796.4 mln dlrs. Williams said the charges in the current year were related to an ongoing restructuring. The company said the restructuring moves had improved its balance sheet and improved the outlook for future stability and growth in earnings. Operating profit at the company's Northwest Pipeline Corp unit fell 4.5 pct to 150 mln dlrs from lower sales. The Williams Natural Gas unit had operating profit of 50.5 mln dlrs compared to 90.9 mln dlrs on lower sales volumes. Profit at Williams Gas Marketing rose to 26 mln dlrs from about 22 mln and the William Pipe Line Co had operating profit of 49.4 mln dlrs versus 63.6 mln dlrs a year ago.

U.S. SAYS USAIR &lt;U> MAY BUY 51 PCT OF PIEDMONT The Department of Transportation said it will allow USAIR Group to acquire up to 51 pct of Piedmont Aviation &lt;PIE> voting stocks pending final approval of the proposed merger of the two airlines. The agency said the stock would have to be held in a voting trust controlled by an independent trustee. An agency spokesman said that if USAIR, which has proposed to buy all of Piedmont shares, controls more than 51 pct of the firm's outstanding stock, it will have one week to sell those excess shares. USAIR asked the Department of Transporation earlier this month to approve a voting trust. An agency spokesman said this is a device that airlines use to get majority control of a company it is trying to acquire while their application before the government is pending approval. The spokesman said the firm had asked the transporation agency permission to buy all of Piedmont's voting stock, the but agency decided to give approval for 51 pct of shares. The spokesman said agency action on the proposed merger application could take as long as six months.  
U.S. CARGO PREFERENCE SQUABBLE CONTINUES The U.S. Agriculture Department said it will begin charging interest tomorrow on the over 12 mln dlrs the Department of Transportation, DOT, owes USDA to pay for its share of the cost of shipping food aid on U.S. vessels. USDA General Sales Manager Melvin Sims told the Senate Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee his department had billed DOT 12 mln dlrs, and that interest on that amount and an additional charge would begin accruing April 1. USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service Administrator Thomas Kay told Reuters DOT could owe USDA as much as 20 mln dlrs. The two departments are trying to hammer out an accord on how to fund the increasing share of food aid required to be shipped on U.S. flag vessels under a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference. Sims said the agencies were near to reaching a memorandum of understanding governing how DOT would pay for its share of the cargo preference costs. Under the 1985 bill, the percentage of food aid shipments carried on U.S. vessels was to increase gradually over three years to 75 pct in 1988 from 50 pct. Although the increased cost was to be funded by DOT, Sims said that department to date has contributed no money.  
UK MAY REVOKE JAPANESE FINANCIAL LICENSES The British government may revoke the licences of selected Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London's financial City when they come up for renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up Japan's markets to foreign competition, government sources said. "We can't say "yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)" but this is definitely being considered," an official said. His comments came after the government was formally urged today by a cross-section of influential MPs to take joint retaliatory action with the United States against Japan. Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanese trade practices. "There's a sense of urgency here now, but the emphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests in Japan," another government official told Reuters. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that Britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliate against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access. She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said. The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7 billion stg, official figures show. A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged the U.K. Government to "coordinate action with the President of the United States, and through the Department of Trade and Industry, to suspend all further applications from Japanese communications companies for equipment approval by the British Approvals Board for Telecommunications, and all further applications from Japanese financial institutions for licences" until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called "restrictive conditions" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC) (cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake in Japan's international telecommunications market. The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-section of MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament. Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on the Conservative government to take firm action. Officials said another option now being considered by the U.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese institutions. That could be done under the government's proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament. 58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal in London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-based firms are authorised to do financial business, officials said. The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied under legally-binding international trade agreements. "The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry Secretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in investment, banking and insurance," one official said. "This point has been made to the Japanese at official level a number times," the official added. Britain and France are now working together to urge that the European Community take collective action against Japan, but by working within EC treaties, another official said. British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio interview that the European Community should build barriers against Japanese imports through certification procedures similar to those facing European exporters in Japan. "There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer," he said, adding "(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight." Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade "strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a fair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is itself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our own domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness." The situation is only likely to worsen following news that Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more than 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrs from 5.7 billion in January, political sources said. But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate. Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial institutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, rather than larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a global business centre, government sources said. Japan's four largest securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange. In Washington, White House officials said President Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States. There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the move could come today or early next week. Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan included tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors.

CAROLIAN SYSTEMS SEES LOWER FISCAL 1987 PROFIT &lt;Carolian Systems International Inc> said it anticipates profit for fiscal 1987 ending June 30 will be lower than fiscal 1986 earnings of 410,000 dlrs, despite an expected revenue increase of 37 pct to more than 3.5 mln dlrs. After an extraordinary expense associated with the December, 1986 withdrawal of a planned common share offering, "we expect to be modestly profitable for the year, but below the 410,000 dlrs earned in fiscal 1986," the company said. Carolian previously reported fiscal six month profit of 12,933 dlrs, excluding an extraordinary loss of 17,210 dlrs, compared to earnings of 69,829 dlrs in the prior year. The company said it anticipated fiscal 1987 earnings to be lower due to withdrawal of its share offering, computer equipment shipment delays and costs associated with sales staff expansion. A strengthening Canadian dollar against U.S. currency will also adversely affect revenues and earnings, since 85 pct of revenues are generated by sales outside Canada, said Carolian, a leading supplier of utility software for Hewlett-Packard computer systems.

SCHLUMBERGER &lt;SLB> MAY HAVE ALTERNATE BUYER Schlumberger Ltd most likely has an alternate buyer lined up for its Fairchild Semiconductor unit, Wall Street analysts said. "I think its clear that in cancelling its agreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger has signaled that it has another deal in the works," said Paul Johnson, a semiconductor analyst with L.F. Rothschild. "There are unquestionably other buyers out there," added Kidder Peabody analyst Adam F. Cuhney. "A lot of companies have looked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it." Among the companies that would be interested in bidding for Fairchild are Advanced Micro Devices &lt;AMD>, Sunnyvale, Calif., and LSI Logic Corp &lt;LLSI>, Milpitas, Calif., industry analysts said. Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp &lt;NSM>, Texas Instruments Inc &lt;TXN> and Motorola Inc &lt;MOT> might also seek to buy Fairchild, but could possibly run into antitrust problems, the analysts added. Moreover, Fairchild's management is thought to be considering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino, Calif., company, analysts said. In a brief statement announcing the termination of the agreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision opened up other possibilities, including a possible buyout by Fairchild management. The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu would have bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs, because rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan administration made it unlikely that the sale could be completed within a reasonable period of time. Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing that the companies did not need government approval to complete the transaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-owned companies. "Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because the U.S. government didn't want it," said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the company's news release. He said only that the company was reviewing a number of possible alternatives for the Fairchild unit. Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately available for comment. Analysts noted the significance of the government's apparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of Fairchild. Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military weapons systems. "The government really stood up for the semiconductor industry," said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. "That, I think, is the real significance of this." Consequently, analysts said, the Japanese government might now feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints about Japanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor trade agreement signed last summer.

MRS FIELDS PLANS TO OPEN MORE STORES U.S. Based speciality food retailer &lt;Mrs Fields Inc>, which earlier announced pre-tax profits of 17.1 mln dlrs in 1986 against 6.8 mln in 1985, said it plans further growth this year with the opening of 125 new stores in the U.S. The company, which is quoted on London's Unlisted Securities Market (USM), said it also planned to expand its outlets internationally. However, chairman Randall Fields told a news conference the company would not move into any new countries during 1987 but would intensify its efforts where it already had stores. During 1986 the company opened 81 new stores, including 76 in the U.S., Two in Australia and one each in Japan, Canada and the U.K. "We intend to open a minimum of five more units in London for example and it is reasonable that we might open other stores in other European countries in 1988," Fields said. He said the company acquired competitive businesses as a matter of routine, and might add others in 1987, but declined to say how much the company planned to spend on them. Last year turnover rose by 20.8 pct to 87.1 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln dlrs in 1985.

U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER FALLS 1.27 BILLION DLRS IN FEB 25 WEEK, FED SAYS  U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER FALLS 1.27 BILLION DLRS IN FEB 25 WEEK, FED SAYS  
HUNGARY HOPES DEVALUATION WILL END TRADE DEFICIT National Bank of Hungary first vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last year's severe trade deficit with the West. Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade. "It is useful to have a devaluation," he said. "There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports." The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today. Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow. He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5.5 pct in 1986). This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s, he added. Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year. But the country's hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3 mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985. Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs. One Western commercial attache here said: "Devaluation of itself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods." Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry. It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market. Hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen. He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation. "I am for credits to invest for that purpose," he said. "I am against credits for consumption." He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986. Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he considered rates to be low. Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints.

INDONESIA LIMITS OIL PRICE IMPACT-FINANCE MINISTER Indonesia has minimised the economic impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said. Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge in crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half. But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the previous year. Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said, although he did not give complete figures. The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber, palm oil, tin, timber and coffee. Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against the dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments. He said the economy would have suffered more from the world economic recession if the government had not devalued the rupiah by 31 pct last September. In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post said the government must press ahead with measures to deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports. The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were needed to finance not only imports but also the country's growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs. "About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due within the next three to five years and will steadily increase the debt servicing burden," the paper said. However, end-investors were seen bargain hunting in expectation of a further yen interest rate decline, dealers said. Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar's nosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest rate rebound to halt further dollar depreciation. A 4.7 pct coupon and volume of 1,400 billion yen for the April 10-year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this afternoon were taken favourably by the market.  
YEUTTER PUTS CURRENCY BURDEN ON TAIWAN, KOREA Responsibility for the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with those countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is in those countries' own long-term interest to raise the value of their currencies against the dollar. Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S. could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits with Taiwain and Korea. "An undervalued currency will help those countries' exports in the short term, but in the long run they have to be concerned about how they are perceived in the international business community," Yeutter said. For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita trade surplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, and with huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defend the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that country. He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, "otherwise in two or three years' time, Korea will be in the same situation that prevails in Taiwan." Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50 billion dlrs, Yeutter said that this situation was not sustainable. "Something must give soon. If not, there is a great threat of U.S. legislative action to counteract that trend," Yeutter said.  
NON-COMMUNIST STEEL OUTPUT CONTINUES TO FALL Steel output in the major non-Communist producing countries fell sharply in February, continuing a long-running trend, International Iron and Steel Institute figures showed. Production in the 30 countries which report their figures to it was 6.9 pct below the February 1986 level at 32.03 mln tonnes. Output in the United States fell 18.5 pct to 5.30 mln tonnes, that in Japan 7.8 pct to 7.27 mln and that in the European Community 6.5 pct to 9.91 mln. The figures continue to indicate a switch away from these traditional major producing countries to the more advanced developing countries. Brazilian February output rose 9.2 pct from year-earlier levels to 1.73 mln tonnes and that in South Korea was up 7.5 pct at 1.17 mln tonnes. The 30 countries covered by the figures account for about 97 pct of world non-Communist steel production, the Institute said.  
CHANNEL FERRY REPORTED SINKING OFF BELGIUM The channel ferry Herald of Free Enterprise from the British Townsend Thorensen company was sinking off the Belgian coast tonight with 463 people on board, the Dutch newsagency ANP reported today. An unspecified number of people had fallen into the water, it said, quoting the pilot organisation in this south-western Dutch port city near the Belgian border. It said the vessel had capsized after a collision but gave no more details. Dan Kaakebeen a spokesman for the Dutch salvage firm Smit International told Reuters by telephone from Rotterdam that the vessel was just off the Belgian port of Zeebrugge with 463 passengers and crew when the accident occurred at 1850 GMT. Kaakebeen said the firm had one vessel at the scene and another on its way with divers on board. A spokesman at the port authority of nearby Vlissingen said attempts were being made to pull the vessel into shallow waters. Weather conditions were good with no fog or wind, and there were many other vessels in the area.

JAPAN, BRITAIN DISAGREE ON TELECOM MERGER Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> is resisting attempts to merge two Japan-based telecommunications firms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force a change in those plans, a company executive said. Cable and Wireless, which holds a 20 pct stake in one of the two Japanese firms, is opposed to plans to reduce its share to three pct in the merged firm, director of corporate strategy Jonathan Solomon told reporters. That plan, put forward by a senior member of the powerful business organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of the Post and Telecommunications Ministry, has caused a storm of protest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreign firms from a meaningful position in the market. Pacific Telesis Group &lt;PAC.N> of the United States also holds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia, &lt;International Digital Communications Inc> (IDC). Solomon said that both British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz have written to the Japanese government about the planned merger. A key U.S. Senate committee, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have also expressed opposition to the merger, he said. The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated again that it sees no need for two competitors to &lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which holds a monopoly on international calls from Japan. The ministry has also suggested that foreign shareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm. In an attempt to hammer out an agreement, Solomon today met Fumio Watanabe, the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange the merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked. At stake is C and W's 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre optic cables between Japan and Alaska, to form part of its global network. "C and W wants to start right away on the project, such as application and other procedures," said Watanabe, who is also chairman of &lt;Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc>. The Japanese side is saying that the decision on such a plan should be left with the new firm, after the merger. "These decisions (on the merger) were made in consideration of Japan's economic conditions and legal systems. I told him we are not a colony or something," said Watanabe.

LAENDERBANK EXPECTS MODEST PROFIT RISE IN '87 Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG [OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a moderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mln schilling net profit made in 1986, General Director Gerhard Wagner said. Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pct rise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due to greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling interest rates. The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividend to 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capital from 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985. Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: "We will endeavour to maintain the higher dividend in 1987." Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7 billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985. Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business chiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which is effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wiped some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total. Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from the bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said that it came close to one mln stg. On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed 8.7 pct to 738.9 mln. According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct. Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state.

RECENT U.S. OIL DEMAND UP 0.1 PCT FROM YEAR AGO U.S. oil demand as measured by products supplied rose 0.1 pct in the four weeks ended March 20 to 16.16 mln barrels per day from 16.15 mln in the same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was off 0.1 pct in the period to 3.258 mln bpd from 3.260 mln a year earlier. Gasoline demand averaged 6.72 mln bpd, off 1.2 pct from 6.80 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.38 mln bpd, off 2.1 pct from 1.41 mln, the EIA said. Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.35 mln bpd, down 7.8 pct from 9.06 mln a year ago, and gross daily crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 3.44 mln bpd, up 16.3 pct from 2.95 mln, the EIA said. Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 11.90 mln bpd, up 1.4 pct from 11.74 mln a year earlier, it said. In the first 78 days of the year, refinery runs were up 1.8 pct to an average 12.25 mln bpd from 12.04 mln in the year-ago period, the EIA said. Year-to-date demand for all petroleum products averaged 16.32 mln bpd, up 1.8 pct from 16.04 mln in 1986, it said. So far this year, distillate demand rose 0.1 pct to 3.31 mln bpd from 3.30 mln in 1986, gasoline demand was 6.60 mln bpd, up 0.1 pct from 6.59 mln, and residual fuel demand fell 0.4 pct to 1.42 mln bpd from 1.43 mln, the EIA said. Year-to-date domestic crude output was estimated at 8.41 mln bpd, off 7.7 pct from 9.11 mln a year ago, while gross crude imports averaged 3.96 mln bpd, up 28.1 pct from 3.09 mln, it said.  
METROMAIL &lt;MTML> SEES FLAT YEAR NET Metromail Corp said it expects earnings for the year to be about flat due to higher expenses caused by an expansion of data processing capabilities and startup costs associated with new cooperative programs that will continue into the fourth quarter. The company today reported earnings for the nine months ended March One of 7,214,900 dlrs, down from 7,752,800 dlrs a year before.  For all of last year it earned 10.9 mln dlrs.  
U.S. SENATE PANEL APPROVES TRADE MISSION BILL The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee approved a bill that would establish farm trade and aid missions to promote the use of U.S. food aid, donation, credit and export subsidy programs by overseas customers. The bill, approved by voice vote, would establish trade missions made up of representatives of the Departments of Agriculture and State, the Agency for International Development, the Overseas Private Investment Corp, market development cooperatives and private voluntary organizations. At least 16 missions would have to be sent within one year after enactment of the bill. The missions would promote U.S. programs, including PL480, Section 416 donations, Export Enhancement Program, the dairy export incentive program, and export credit guarantee programs (GSM-102, GSM-103). The panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill, offered by Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), that would have required the U.S. Agriculture Department to donate at least one mln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries. Current law requires USDA to donate at least 750,000 tonnes of surplus grains and dairy products under the Section 416 food donation program. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposed increase in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost up to 50 mln dlrs per year, Senate staff said. The committee also dropped a provision identifying which countries would be the focus of the trade missions' activities. Under the bill adopted by the committee, countries "friendly to the United States" would be eligible to host the trade missions. Melcher originally had proposed sending missions to Mexico, the Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Senegal, Nigeria, Peru, Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, Tunisia and Morocco. The bill also would require the Foreign Agricultural Service, FAS, to have at least 850 full-time employees during fiscal years 1987-89. As of February 28, FAS had 790 full-time employees, a FAS spokesman said.

KUWAIT MINISTER SAYS NO EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS SET Kuwait's oil minister said in a newspaper interview that there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting after the recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying that "none of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting." He also denied that Kuwait was pumping above its OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd). Crude oil prices fell sharply last week as international oil traders and analysts estimated the 13-nation OPEC was pumping up to one million bpd over its self-imposed limits.  
BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT The Bank of England again fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high. It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said. Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want to. The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to relieve a money market shortage. "They're really making the discount houses suffer," said Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew. "Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates." This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came strongly into the pound. The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60 marks, up from 2.8720/50. "If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that rates could drop before the Budget," said Jeremy Hale, economist at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp. Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow. However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating rather than a result of short-term speculative gains. There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co. Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds, Fellner said. An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most forecasts say it will be this year. Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar. However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether. The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there. Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan. They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in Washington. The Bank may want to see another few points on the trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. "But by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of England," he added. The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders. Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg. This was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985. Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals. The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow. If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point cut, with another half or full point about Budget day.  
HOG REPORT SHOWS MORE HOGS ON FARMS The USDA quarterly hogs and pig report yesterday showed more hogs on U.S. farms compared to last year as profitability resulting from low grain prices encouraged producers to step up production, analysts said. Most analysts seemed to agree with Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor traders that the report will be viewed as bearish to pork futures and futures prices may open sharply lower today. Some traders and analysts expect limit declines in nearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle. University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,"The report shows that hog producers have responded to a very desirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10 months." Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futures prices are above producers' break even points. Even if futures fell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could still lock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavy selling pressure today. "We have not had a period of profitability of this magnitude since last summer," Levitt said. "In fact, hog operations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have been so profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get back on their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hog operation alone." Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also was negative, in that some lead time was anticipated before the slaughter increased from the previous year. We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but we didn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-state spring report, Levitt added. High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn that could be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increased profits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations to increase production starting late last year. Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hog herd resulted from a revision of the December report and without the revision, the March report might have been very close to average expectations. Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a major upward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breeding herd in the December 1 report. So the December report was more bearish than initially indicated. But Fuller, as well as other analysts, expected the report to be less negative on deferred futures contracts. Distant contracts are already at a sharp discount to cash because traders anticipated high farrowing intentions, she noted. Discounts in the October and December contracts take into consideration a six to seven pct increase in March/May farrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1 report, Fuller said. Grimes said, "As far as the distant months are concerned, if our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60 lb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take a tremendous discount in price for each percent increase for us to push down to the prices that the current futures show for the July and August period." Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted that distant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower than they were last summer. "If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrs during July, that doesn't mean hogs have to be 15 dlrs cheaper this year because we have six pct more numbers," he said.

U.K. CONFIRMS JANUARY STERLING M3 RISE The Bank of England said the broad measure of U.K. Money supply, Sterling M3, rose a seasonally adjusted 1.1 pct in January after a 0.2 pct rise in December. The unadjusted year-on-year rise was 17.6 pct after 18.1 pct in the year to December. The narrow measure of money supply, M0, fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.6 pct in January, and rose by a non-adjusted 4.1 pct year-on-year, the Bank said. The figures confirm provisional data issued by the Bank two weks ago. In December, M0 grew by a seasonally adjusted 1.4 pct and by a non-seasonally adjusted 5.2 pct year-on-year. The Bank said sterling bank lending grew by a non-seasonally adjusted 1.75 billion stg in January. This also confirmed provisional figures issued in February. The measure of private sector liquidity, PSL2, fell 0.2 pct in January, but after seasonal adjustment rose 0.6 pct, the Bank said. The Bank said the public sector contribution to the growth in Sterling M3 was contractionary by about 2.3 billion stg. Within this, the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) showed a repayment of 3.7 billion stg, while the non-bank private sector's holdings of government debt fell by about 1.1 billion stg. There was a fall of 290 mln stg in notes and coin in January, a fall of 1.5 billion stg in non-interest bearing sight deposits, and a rise of 1.6 billion stg in interest bearing sight deposits, the Bank said.  
CLAREMONT TO BOOST CHAMPION PRODUCTS &lt;CH> STAKE Claremont Group Ltd, a New York investment banking firm, said it intends to boost its current 10 pct stake in Champion Products Inc to as much as 15 pct of the total outstanding common stock.

LOOPHOLE FOR TANKERS IN NORWAY'S S. AFRICA BAN Norway's parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said. The unilateral boycott gives domestic companies until late September to cut trade ties with South Africa and Namibia. Although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, the boycott makes a crucial exception for ships whose final destination is decided while at sea. As oil cargoes are often resold after loading, critics said the door will be left open for continued shipments to South Africa. Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude oil imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months, trade ministry officials said. The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure. The boycott legislation now goes to the upper house for formal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said.

U.S. CHIPMAKERS URGE SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN The Semiconductor Industry Association urged the U.S. government to impose trade sanctions against Japan for violating the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement. In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as of April 1 and continue until the U.S. is satisfied there is full compliance with the agreement. The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor exports is not what is required. "America's interests require that agreements be honored and that U.S. industries not bear the burden for the persistent unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to deliver on its commitments," the trade group said. The White House Economic Policy Council is expected to discuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduled for Thursday. The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of the agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to foreign-based manufacturers.

MIDDLE SOUTH &lt;MSU> TO FORM NEW DIVIDEND POLICY Middle South Utilities Inc is taking a conversative approach to formulating a new common stock dividend policy, chairman Edwin Lupberger said. He told securities analysts that when the company's common dividend is resumed, "the initial rate will appear conservative to you by industry standards and in relation MSU's net income and cash flow." "Our progress will determine how soon we can reinstate a dividend to our common stockholders, he said." The company last paid a common dividend of 44.5 cts a share in July 1985. Lupberger told the analysts that the company's primary objective is "to create financial strength, enough strength so that what happened to us and our stockholders over the past couple of years never happens again." The company has faced regulatory challenges to rates proposed to cover the cost of its Grand Gulf nuclear plant. He said Middle South's net income is expected to post "modest growth" over the next three years. In 1986, the company earned 451.3 mln dlrs or 2.21 dlrs a share on revenues of 3.49 billion dlrs. Lupberger said, "A good portion of the improvement projected for the next three years comes from keeping the lid on operating and maintenance expenses."

CHINESE PORT UNDERUSED DESPITE CONGESTION NEARBY The Chinese port of Ningbo is working well below capacity despite being only 130 miles from Shanghai, which is seriously congested, a port official said. Jiang Feng Xiang said the port -- the deepest in China -- handled 17.95 mln tonnes of cargo last year, up from 10.44 mln in 1985, but well below its potential capacity of 32 mln tonnes. Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986. Jiang said Ningbo is under-utilised because of its inadequate facilities, including a single track rail line linking it to Hangzhou, where it joins the national network. Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coal from north to south China and imports include fertiliser and soda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia. The docks can handle ships of up to 150,000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to 200,000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour. Most of Ningbo's port infrastructure has been built since 1979, official publications show. A container berth and two timber and three general cargo berths will be added during the current 1986-90 five-year plan, Jiang said. "The rail line to Hangzhou will be double tracked by 1995. By 2000, maybe, we will overtake Shanghai," he added.

EUROPEAN COMMUNITY TO SET UP OFFICE IN PEKING China and the European Community (EC) signed an agreement on the establishment of an EC office here. Chinese vice-foreign minister Zhou Nan and the EC's external relations commissioner, Willy De Clercq, signed the accord. EC sources said the office was likely to open in the second half of this year. In 1986 the EC was China's third largest trading partner, with Chinese imports from the EC worth 5.7 billion dlrs and exports worth 2.6 billion dlrs. De Clercq told the official China Daily that more joint ventures should be set up in China as a way of reducing China's trade deficit with the EC. The EC's affairs in China are currently looked after by whichever country holds the group's six-monthly rotating presidency, now held by the Belgians until the Danes take over in July.  
MIM TO ACQUIRE STAKE IN GERMAN COPPER PRODUCER Mount Isa Mines Holding Ltd plans to acquire a 30 pct stake in Europe's largest primary copper producer, Norddeutsche Affinerie AG, a spokesman for Metallgesellschaft AG said. MIM intends to take Preussag AG's total 20 pct share in the copper producer in exchange for some three pct of MIM's share capital. MIM will also take another 10 pct now held by Degussa AG, reducing Degussa's share to 30 pct from 40. Metallgesellschaft's share will remain at 40 pct. The move is subject to approval of the federal cartel office and supervisory boards of the companies involved.

DEUTSCHE AGREES FULL TAKEOVER OF FORMER EURASBANK Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> has agreed to take over the outstanding 25 pct in &lt;Deutsche Bank (Asia) AG>, the former &lt;European Asian Bank AG>, from Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI>, Deutsche management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen told a news conference. Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding from Deutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal with Creditanstalt. Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover of Lloyds Bank plc &lt;LLOY.L> were without foundation, he said. Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recent capital increase of &lt;Morgan Grenfell Group plc>, but had no plans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell. &lt;Banca d'America e d'Italia SpA>, in which 98.3 pct was acquired from Bankamerica Corp &lt;BAC.N> late last year, would be consolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion of Deutsche's business, management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said. Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal High Court, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in the balance sheet section "participations," Christians said. But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in these non-bank companies as an investment rather than an active participation. Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marks in 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a rise to 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations. Herrhausen said the grouping of holdings in the balance sheet in this was was not a first step to floating them off in a separate holding company.  
U.S. NAVY SAID INCREASING PRESENCE NEAR GULF Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger has ordered the U.S. Navy to increase its presence near the Gulf in an effort to fulfil President Reagan's pledge to keep oil flowing to Europe and Japan, The New York Times reported. The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navy would keep the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk on station in the Arabian Sea and the rest of the Indian Ocean until May, three months longer than planned. The Navy would then have a carrier battle group of six to eight warships in the area at all times rather than part of the time, as happens now, the paper said. The paper said that last month U.S. Intelligence sources said they had spotted land-based anti-ship missiles of a Chinese design known in the West as the HY-2 near the Strait of Hormuz. It said their purpose was seen as a signal Iran was ready to continue and perhaps step up the Gulf shipping war against Iraq. U.S. Carriers or battleships would sail out of range of those missiles, but within striking distance, the paper quoted officials as saying. From several hundred miles at sea, carriers could launch aircraft bombing runs or missile strikes, and battleships could fire long-range missiles, the paper said.

U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY RULES OUT GASOLINE TAX Energy Secretary John Herrington said he would rule out a tax on gasoline as one option to help avert what his departmet has called the threat of increased reliance on foreign oil in the coming years. He said at a news conference that any recommendation he would make would have to increase domestic production, not cause widespread economic hardship and have a minimal cost to the U.S. taxpayer. On the grounds of increasing production, he said, "I would rule out a gasoline tax." Herrington also repeated he would rule out an oil import fee because of the widespread dislocation it would cause -- the loss of about 400,000 jobs nationwide due to higher oil prices and a drop in the gross national product by about 32 billion dlrs. He said an increased depletion allowance, to 27.5 pct, on new and enhanced production of oil and natural gas would be a cheap way to spur domestic production. He estimated this cost at about 200 mln dlrs a year. Herrington proposed the increased depletion allowance to the White House Tuesday but the White House reaction was cool. The White House said it would study the proposal, but was generally oppposed to altering the national tax code, just passed last year. Herrington, asked his reaction to the White House reaction, said, "If I were the White House, I would be cool, too."  
COURT ENJOINS TENDER FOR BANCROFT &lt;BTV> Bancroft Convertible Fund said the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey issued a preliminary injunction, enjoining &lt;Zico Investment Holding Inc's> tender offer for Bancroft. It said the Court order prevents Zico from buying any shares tendered to them during the offer, which began on Feb. 17, 1987. In the tender offer blocked by the Court, Zico offered to buy 500,000 shares, or about 22 pct of Bancroft's outstanding stock, for 30 dlrs a share. Previously, Zico had bought 965,000 Bancroft shares for 31 dlrs a share, giving it about 28 pct of the company. If the recent offer had gone through, the Zico would have owned slightly more than 50 pct of Bancroft's outstanding shares.

Prior to this move Innovex owned 79 pct of Lucht, the company said. Innovex said it bought the shares by exchanging 293,101 shares of unregistered Innovex common stock. Innovex president, Thomas Haley, said the exchange is non-dilutive and will cause a slight increase in Innovex's fully diluted earnings per share during the last half of fiscal 1987. Lucht will continue to function as a unit of Innovex, Innovex said.  
NO CLEAR EVIDENCE TRADE GAP REVERSED - VOLCKER Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said current data does not give a clear sign that the deterioration in the U.S. trade balance has yet been reversed. "The data we have in hand do not provide clearcut evidence that the deterioration in the trade balance has yet been reversed," Volcker said in remarks prepared for delivery to a luncheon for community leaders here. However, Volcker said there are encouraging signs, particularly the rising volume of exports over the past year, achieved despite relatively slow growth abroad. Volcker warned it is not sustainable from an economic perspective to pile up foreign debt while failing to make the investment needed to generate growth and earn the money to service the debt. He said the process of restoring external balance to the U.S. economy requires dealing with the budget deficit. He said needed economic adjustment will require a relative shift of financial and real resources into internationally competitive industry. "More of our growth will need to be reflected in net exports and business investment and less in consumption," Volcker said.

AM INTERNATIONAL &lt;AM> CITES STRONG PROSPECTS AM International Inc, reporting an operating loss for the January 31 second quarter, said prospects for the balance of the fiscal year remain good. It said orders at its Harris Graphics subsidiary, acquired in June 1986, "continue to run at a strong pace." For the six months, orders rose 35 pct over the corresponding prior-year period, or on an annualized basis are running at about 630 mln dlrs. The backlog at Harris is up 30 pct from the beginning of the fiscal year, AM said. AM International said its old division are expected to benefit from recent new product introductions and the decline in the value of the dollar. "Research, development and engineering expenditures in fiscal 1987 will be in the 45-50 mln dlr range, and the company said it has allocated another 30-40 mln dlrs for capital expenditures. Earlier AM reported a fourth quarter operating loss of two cts a share compared to profits of seven cts a share a year ago. Revenues rose to 291.8 mln dlrs from 151.1 mln dlrs.  
U.S. REAL EARNINGS ROSE 0.6 PCT IN FEBRUARY The average weekly earnings of U.S. workers after adjustment for inflation and seasonal changes rose 0.6 pct in February after being unchanged in January, the Labor department said. The department had earlier reported that real earnings fell 0.3 pct in January but revised the figure to show earnings unchanged. Between February this year and February, 1986, real earnings rose 0.5 pct, the department said. The rise in February real earnings resulted from a 0.5 pct increase in average hourly earnings and a 0.6 pct increase in average weekly hours. That was partly offset by a 0.4 pct rise in the consumer price index, which measures inflation, the department said. Before seasonal adjustment, weekly earnings last month averaged 307.59 dlrs, up from 305.13 dlrs in January and up from 300.66 dlrs in February, 1986. Reuter...  
MAJOR NATIONS MUST ACT ON CURRENCIES - MIYAZAWA Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the time has come for major industrialised nations to take action on exchange rates in line with their agreement last month in Paris. In Paris, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to coooperate to hold currency rates around their then current levels. Miyazawa would not say what specific measures major nations would take, but told reporters the measures had been discussed in Paris. The dollar fell to a record low against the yen this morning, piercing the 150 yen barrier.

CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets. Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low. Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees. With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal, traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances. An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop, means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized, traders said. Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the more attractive deal from the government, they added. Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton. One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans, which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

MINISTERS FEEL EC FORECASTS TOO PESSIMISTIC European Community finance ministers discussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and many said a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was too pessimistic. The Commission, the EC's executive authority, two weeks ago cut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3 per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn. It said economic prospects had been less promising over the past few months because of a sharp fall in the value of the dollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which would restrain Community exports. But diplomats said several member states, led by West Germany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy, especially since it was drafted before a recent agreement between the leading Western economic powers to stabilise currencies around current levels. "Many delegations feel the (Commission's) report is rather too pessimistic," said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who chaired the meeting. The Commission, which slashed its growth forecast for West Germany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent, has made clear it feels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures to stimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe. But two top German officials, State Secretaries Otto Schlecht and Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters Bonn saw no need at the moment for action to bolster the EC's biggest economy. The diplomats said they were backed by Britain and France, while Italy, Greece and Denmark supported the Commission's view that Bonn should bring in new measures to aid EC growth.

BURMESE PADDY PRODUCTION LOWER IN 1986/87 Burma's paddy production fell to 729.4 mln baskets in fiscal year 1986-1987 (to end March) from 737.3 mln in 1985-1986, a cabinet report to parliament said. A basket is a local measure equal to 46 lbs. Paddy output in 1984-1985 was 699.1 mln baskets, it said. Burma's "Green Revolution" sparked by the introduction of high-yield variety paddy strains in the mid-1970s appears to have hit a plateau with production levelling off over the past two years, economists said.  
EAST RAND MINES EXPECT HIGHER GOLD PRODUCTION East Rand Proprietary Mines Ltd said that barring any major disruption in production, it expects 1987 gold output to top 10 tonnes after dropping to 9.223 tonnes last year from 10.251 in 1985. Chairman Clive Knobbs said in the annual report the mine was expected to mill a higher tonnage while capital expenditure during 1987 will be around 118.5 mln rand. The decline in gold production last year was due to a four pct drop in tonnage milled and a seven pct decline in grade.  
OREGON ALUMINUM SMELTER INCREASING OUTPUT Northwest Aluminum Co said it will open a second pot line in mid-May, bringing the smelter here to 80 pct of its production capacity. Northwest Aluminum President Brett Wilcox, who leased the 30-year-old smelter from Martin Marietta Corp., said production would increase from around 45 tons a year at present to just over 70 tons. Martin Marietta closed and mothballed the smelter in 1984. Northwest Aluminum reopened it last December. Wilcox said a good aluminum market and several months of successful operation led to the decision to expand production.

PENNZOIL (PZL) WILLING TO SETTLE TEXACO (TX) LAWSUIT Pennzoil Co said it had not yet received any "meaningful settlement offer" from Texaco Inc but added that the company remained willing to consider proposals to settle the 10.2 billion dlr jury judgment it won against Texaco. In its newly-released annual report to shareholders, Pennzoil said it expected the Texas state court judgment, which was upheld by a state appeals court on February 12, to be upheld if appealed again. "To date, Pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful settlement offer from Texaco, though it remains open to any realistic effort to settle the matter," Pennzoil chairman Hugh Liedtke said in the annual report. Pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital spending in 1987, a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year. Proved U.S. and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to 964 billion cubic feet last year, from 1.01 trillion cubic feet in 1985, because of a virtual halt in its exploration program, Pennzoil said. Its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln barrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985. The Houston-based company said it sold an average of 339 mln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year, a 17 pct drop from 1985. The average sales price for gas dropped by 60 cents per mcf to 2.16 dlrs per mcf, Pennzoil said. U.S. crude oil and gas liquids production last year fell to an average of 33,290 barrels per day from 34,102 barrels per day in 1985. The company's total revenues in 1986 declined to 482.3 mln dlrs, from 762.5 mln dlrs the previous year. Operating income in 1986 fell more than 80 pct, to 38.0 mln dlrs. Pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of its Point Arguello oilfield off the California coast, to maintain current production levels in its Bluebell-Altamont Field in Utah and to drill for prospects in the Gulf of Mexico's Mobile Bay area. "Production should begin late in the year from the Harvest Platform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California," the company said. "Pennzoil's share of this production initially should be five thousand barrels a day, increasing to a peak of 15 thousand barrels a day, net, by 1989." In its sulphur business, Pennzoil said production totaled 2.1 mln long tons last year, a decline of 18 pct from 1985. The average sales price also declined, to 138.25 dlrs per long ton from 141.05 dlrs in 1985. "The long term outlook for our sulphur operations remains bright," the company said. "We expect sulphur's pricing structure to strengthen during the current year, probably in the third and fourth quarters."  
U.S., ARGENTINA SETTLE SOYPRODUCT CASE - YEUTTER U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the United States and Argentina have settled a case brought by the U.S. soybean crushing industry alleging unfair subsidies to Argentina's crushing industry. Speaking to an Agribusiness Education forum here late yesterday, Yeutter said the case was resolved at a meeting with Argentine Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figuerras during a trade ministers' meeting in New Zealand last week. Under a verbal understanding between the two ministers, Argentina will soon abolish export taxes on soybeans and products, U.S. and Argentine officials said. The U.S. case brought by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association alleged Argentina, through differential export taxes, implicitly subsidized domestic soybean crushers. The U.S. crushing industry, in its complaint under Section 301 of trade law, said higher Argentine export taxes on soybeans than on products encourage the export of products and represented an unfair trade practice. Yeutter told Figuerras that all agencies of the U.S. government supported the U.S. complaint and unless Argentina took steps to eliminate the taxes, the United States would consider taking further action in the case, U.S. and Argentine officials said. An Argentine official here said no timetable was given for removal of the Argentine export taxes.

BANKERS OPPOSE STRICT TAIWAN CURRENCY CONTROLS Taiwan imposed currency controls today in what bankers called a desperate move to prevent speculation as the Taiwan dollar appreciated against the U.S. currency. The strict controls will require proof that large remittances to Taiwan are connected to commercial transactions rather than currency speculation. Bankers attacked the controls as ineffective, saying they were a panic reaction to pressure from Washington for faster appreciation of the Taiwan currency against the U.S. dollar, which would slow exports to the United States. Remittances exceeding one mln dlrs earned through exports, shipping, insurance or bank lending will now need government approval, along with remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any other source.

LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS TO MEET IN APRIL Leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability, but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth. The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem likely to build on that stability. A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm. But he said in an interview that financial markets also understood, "That all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in fact what has happened since Paris." Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives. Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings. The official refused to comment, however, on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year. On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth. The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future international talks. "I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the Congress and the better off we are in international fora," said the official, an Administration economic policymaker. "So it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives." But the official also said the Administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability. Currency analysts believe the Paris agreement set secret short-term target ranges for their currencies with a specific agreement to defend those bands with intervention. According to market sources, the ranges agreed were 1.60 to 1.90 marks to the dollar, and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar. There is no official confirmation that specific bands  were set, although the agreement used the term "ranges", for the first time in an international economic agreement. The Paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to foster currency stability around current levels. Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached 1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling's strength. International monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers, who will review market performance and their own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the International Monetary Fund. The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker. Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing, while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing. Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if the Fed was ready to follow suit. A Reagan Administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in Germany. But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the Fed and the Bundesbank. "If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked about it, it would no longer be private," said the official, who asked not to be identified. Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S. Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated action could be on the April agenda.

IOWA BEEF LIFTS LOCKOUT AT DAKOTA CITY Iowa Beef Processors Inc is lifting a lockout at its Dakota City, Nebraska, processing plant and plans to resume operations March 16, United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Union spokesman Allen Zack said. Iowa Beef mailed a letter to members of UFCW Local 222 informing them a lockout imposed by the company December 14 would be lifted and meatpackers could return to work under Iowa Beef's "revised, last and best final offer," Zack said. Iowa Beef had closed the plant indefinitely in mid-December because it said it had no alternative to threats by meatpackers to disrupt operations. About 2,800 members of Local 222 are affected by the shutdown. A 3-1/2 year labor contract at the plant expired December 13.

AMERICAN PORK CONGRESS KICKS OFF TOMORROW The American Pork Congress kicks off tomorrow, March 3, in Indianapolis with 160 of the nations pork producers from 44 member states determining industry positions on a number of issues, according to the National Pork Producers Council, NPPC. Delegates to the three day Congress will be considering 26 resolutions concerning various issues, including the future direction of farm policy and the tax law as it applies to the agriculture sector. The delegates will also debate whether to endorse concepts of a national PRV (pseudorabies virus) control and eradication program, the NPPC said. A large trade show, in conjunction with the congress, will feature the latest in technology in all areas of the industry, the NPPC added.  
TALKING POINT/AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> American Express Co's plan to sell a stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be a prelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit, analysts said. American Express earlier said it has a general understanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a 13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs. The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks, as investors speculated on the possibility of more investment in the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns. The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response to the relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S. firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a price of 2.7 times book value. Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks, depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insider trading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8 times book value. American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. For the last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors of a spinoff of part of Shearson. Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will benefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly important Tokyo financial markets. "I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step," said Long. "What you will see probably in the future is American Express selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and have a public vehicle for Shearson," Long said. "Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitment into an illiquid situation," he said of Nippon. Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in Shearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, like other investment banks, needs capital to expand globally. American express has said the total employees of shearson will expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, that number is substantially lower than growth last year, a company spokesman said. American Express officials would not comment beyond a statement made this morning. That statement, however, did not close off the possibility of a public offering or other option for Shearson. David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possible Shearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believes the firm will digest the Nippon investment first. "I think they'll figure out what they're going to do with the money they have," he said. Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also said American Express could determine to sell shares to the public. In its statement, the financial services giant said it is continuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to the investment by Nippon. American Express said options under study range from expanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competition to broadening its access to capital. American Express also said the options reflect the continuing integral role of Shearson in American Express' worldwide financial services strategy. Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding a Japanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake to Sumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion. Analysts speculated there will be more such matches. "Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. They don't have the money. There's just not enough internal capital growth," said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows other U.S. brokerage companies. Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, are interested in the expertise of American brokers. "Those (Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies have the capital needs and the growth opportunities to use the money. That's a nice marriage," he said.

SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES The Securities and Exchange Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for the shares of companies that they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed. Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid. Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions. As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached. In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said clarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived, even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so. The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a "material change" of the tender offer under U.S. securities law, SEC officials said. The SEC has already said that other specific material changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer. The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived. SEC officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days. The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information. Officials declined to identify the two offers. "If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination," the SEC said. Federal securities law requires that all tender offers remain open for at least 20 business days.  
HOUSE 0/92 FARM PLAN MARKUP DELAYED TILL TUESDAY A House Agriculture Committee meeting to draft a disaster aid bill containing a controversial 0/92 provision has been postponed until next Tuesday, committee staff members announced. The bill contains a provision implementing a 0/92 acreage reduction plan for 1986 wheat and 1987 winter wheat, thereby making payments available to farmers who were not able to plant last year's winter wheat crop because of flooding. Controversy exists over whether the 0/92 provisions of the bill should be expanded, cut back or left as is.

Last week Taft rejected a 145 dlr-a-share bid by Theta, an investment group headed by Taft's vice chairman, Dudley Taft. Taft also said the new proposal would be submitted to the board but no decision had been made with respect to the sale of the company. In the proposal, Theta said it was prepared to discuss all aspects of the offer including price, structure and form of consideration and would be prepared to negotiate a transaction in which shareholders would receive a value in excess of 150 dlrs per share. Taft said Theta requested that the company cooperate and provide it with information subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement. The company declined to comment beyond this statement.

LINEAR FILMS &lt;LNER> SEES LOWER FOURTH QTR NET Linear Films Inc said it sees lower earnings in the fourth quarter ending March 31 compared with a year ago due to lower profit margins on stretch film from price increases of polyethelene resin, a key raw material. In last year's fourth quarter it earned 1,235,000 dlrs or 19 cts a share, a spokesman said. The company said it is raising its stretch film prices by six pct as of April 15 to reflect the higher costs of polyethelene resin. It also said sale volume of stretch film in the fourth quarter was lower than anticipated, although it has returned to normal in recent weeks.  
CANADA UPHOLDS COUNTERVAIL DUTY ON U.S. CORN The Canadian Import Tribunal ruled today subsidized U.S. corn imports were injurious to Canadian growers and upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S. cts a bushel set earlier this year. The ruling is the result of trade action launched in 1985 by the Ontario Corn Producers Association that contended U.S. subsidies were driving American corn prices below Canadian production costs. A spokesman for the Department of Revenue said a study of the level of the duty will be undertaken in the next six months to determine if it should be adjusted.

IRAN WARNS U.S. NOT TO INTERVENE IN THE GULF The speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Hojatoleslam Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, warned the U.S. Not to intervene in the Gulf, a day after Washington said its warships were available to escort Kuwaiti tankers through the waterway. "If U.S. Intervention occurs, the entire world will become insecure for the Americans and the events of Lebanon could be repeated for the Americans everywhere," he said. U.S. Defence officials disclosed in Washington yesterday that the U.S. Navy, which has about 24 warships in or near the Gulf, was prepared to escort Kuwaiti tankers, regular targets for Iranian attacks in an offshoot of its war with Iraq. Rafsanjani, in an interview reported by the Iranian news agency IRNA, also commented on earlier U.S. Disclosures that Iran had erected sites for new Chinese-made Silkworm anti-shipping missiles at the Strait of Hormuz. The agency, received in London, quoted him as saying that Iran did not need missiles to close the strait, 24 miles wide at its narrowest, because "we can close it with artillery only." He added "We have the longest coasts and the highest interest here and the small southern (Gulf) states have a lesser interest compared with us and therefore it is natural for us to protect the security of the Strait of Hormuz more than others."  
BOLIVIAN MINERS CALL GENERAL STRIKE About 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation, Comibol, declared a general strike as from midnight (0400 gmt) to press for higher salaries, a statement by the federation for Bolivian mine workers said. It said the strike was called to defend the nationalised mining industry. The miners were willing to negotiate with the government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, but only if it showed an intention to meet the strikers' demands. The government said the strike was designed to cause it embarrassment during the four-day visit of West German President Richard Von Weizsaecker, which starts on Friday.

CSCE RESTRUCTURES COFFEE FUTURES DAILY LIMITS The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange has expanded the normal daily trading limit in Coffee "C" contracts to 6.0 cents a lb, from the previous 4.0 cents, effective today, the CSCE said. The new daily limits apply to all but the two nearby positions, currently May and July, which trade without limits. In addition, the 6.0 cent limit can be increased to 9.0 cents a lb if the first two limited months both make limit moves in the same direction for two consecutive sessions, according to the CSCE announcement. Before the rule change today, the CSCE required two days of limit moves in the first three restricted contracts before expanding the daily trading limit. Under new guidelines, if the first two restricted deliveries move the 6.0 cent limit for two days the Exchange will expand the limit. The expanded 9.0 cent limit will remain in effect until the settling prices on both of the first two limited months has not moved by more than the normal 6.0 cent limit for other contracts in two successive trading sessions, the CSCE said.

KLOECKNER UND CO'S 1986 PROFIT FALLS ABOUT 20 PCT Kloeckner &amp; Co KGaA, the international trading group, said its 1986 domestic group net profit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that the profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves. The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985. It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary because of recent declines in raw material prices. Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in prices as well as the lower value of the dollar. It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held largely by family foundations. Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participation certificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yield of around 10 pct. Holders of the certificates are entitled to a quarter of the 1986 payment, or around 2.50 marks, the company added.

AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlr acquisition of Gelco Corp's &lt;GEC> Canadian unit has dramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry, largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company officials and analysts said. State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's second largest overnight courier business just two months after another Canadian company, &lt;Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved the acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp &lt;PCC>. But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies and likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying out foreign owned courier operations. "It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people at the right time," McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst Tony Hine commented. The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S. companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off their Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin. "There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being under siege or taking someone else over," he said. Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd as part of its previously announced program to sell off four operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco Express marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters. The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program, and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of debt by year-end, the company said. While company officials declined to disclose earnings and revenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant position in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs a year. The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit formed an important part of a company restructuring program, adopted after another Canadian Company, &lt;Unicorp Canada Corp>, acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would consider acquiring the whole company. Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business. For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier business represents an "excellent financial investment" in a market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman Esther Szynkarsky said. The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in EMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service. It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs. She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline business. Gelco will continue to operate with current management, independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already operates its own air cargo business that includes a small door-to-door courier operation. "They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doing well in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keep it," Szynkarsky said. Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery network, generating traffic for the former parent companies without them having to tie up capital in Canada. "The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is incremental revenue," Hine said. "It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in place the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff through, the more money you make," he added.

POUND AND CANADIAN DOLLAR CAPTURING ATTENTION Interest in the currency futures market has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially explosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continental and Japanese currencies, analysts said. The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the past week-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to the dollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom. "Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...and technically, the pound is in the best shape," PaineWebber analyst Jason Gillard said. "We've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, and we're going to stay with that, there's no reason to change," Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said. Many traders took on long pound/short West German mark futures positions, although some of those cross-trades were liquidated yesterday, Sloane said. The fundamental keys to the pound's rise have been relatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimism surrounding the British economy, analysts said. "Money seems to be chasing yields," William Byers, of Bear Stearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate. Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the pound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down interest rates after the nation's budget is released March 17. The budget itself could have an impact, depending on how well it is received, but analysts say relative interest rates and oil income remain the main influences on the currency. However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K. interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cut their discount rates, and extend the pound's rally, Sloane said. The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, but Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon. The sideways price pattern in the June contract, with smaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a "bull flag" on price charts, technically-oriented analysts said. "It makes for an explosive type of situation that often leads to a breakout," in this case to the upside, Sloane said. Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian dollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recent close at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar. "At this stage of the game I'd call the market long-term positive, but for the technical burden of proof you need a close above (the previous contract high of) 75.25," Byers said. As to the traditionally more active currencies, stability was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts. Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and June German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400, respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430. Yesterday's rebound showed the market was still very respectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bank intervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada. "We may still probe to see what the parameters are," Byers said, "but people are very reluctant because they don't know where the central banks will be (to intervene)." Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price consolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundly sluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer at that level.

EC MINISTERS AGREE NEED FOR BIG STEEL CLOSURES European Community (EC) industry ministers today declared there is a need for a massive round of closures of steel plants to bring capacity in the 12-country bloc into reasonable balance with demand. The ministers were meeting to discuss a plan for voluntary plant closures drawn up by the industry lobby group Eurofer which it calculates would cost around 22,000 jobs. Diplomats said that in their initial reactions to the scheme, most ministers declared it was a useful basis for discussion, but did not go nearly far enough. Eurofer says it has identified scope for the closure of plants which have an annual capacity of 15.26 mln tonnes, provided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the EC or national governments for redundancy and other social costs. But EC Executive Commission sources said Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers today that 30 mln tonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and should be closed by the end of 1990. He said the Eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpoint the scope for closure in heavy hot-rolled wide-strip products, typically produced in plants employing thousands of people. The sources said no minister challenged Narjes' analysis that four or five hot-rolled wide-strip lines would have to close. They said ministers agreed that the Eurofer plan should be expanded and developed through meetings among the industry body, the Commission and representatives of member states. However, diplomats said it was clear from today's discussions that such meetings will be difficult. They said member states are split on whether to reduce the scope of a quota production system, which at present protects EC steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct of their products, while talks on the closure plan proceed. It was also clear that there will be tough talks on which EC member states should bear the brunt of the closures and on how much funding for help to those thrown out of work should come from Community coffers. German minister Martin Bangemann said his country's steel industry, the largest in the EC, should not suffer proportionately more than others, German sources said. But British diplomats said their minister, Giles Shaw, insists that the profitability of companies should be taken into account. The state owned British Steel Corporation, benefitting from massive recent write-offs of its accumulated debts, is currently one of the few EC steel companies in the black. Ministers were this afternoon trying to agree a joint statement on the Eurofer plan and the situation in the industry.

FED EXPECTED TO SET CUSTOMER REPURCHASES The Federal Reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to add reserves via two to 2.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, economists said. Economists said the Fed will inject temporary reserves indirectly to offset pressure on the Federal funds rate associated with quarterly corporate tax payments to the Treasury department. Fed funds opened at 6-1/4 pct and remained at that level late this morning. Friday funds averaged 6.05 pct.  
TAIWAN ISSUES MORE CDS TO CURB MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH The central bank has issued 7.08 billion dlrs worth of certificates of deposit (CDs), bringing the value of CD issues so far this year to 93.29 billion, a bank spokesman told Reuters. The new CDs, with maturities of six months, one year and two years, carry interest rates ranging from 3.9 to 5.15 pct. The issues are designed to help curb the growth of the M-1B money supply which has expanded along with Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, the spokesman said. The reserves reached a record high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs Wednesday.  
AMERICAN CITY &lt;AMBJ> SETS INITIAL PREFERRED DIV American City Business Journals Inc said it declared an initial dividend of 15.4 cts a share on its recent issue of 1.6 mln shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock.

The preferred stock was issued on February 23.  
CENTRONICS &lt;CEN> SETS PREFERRED PURCHASE RIGHTS Centronics Corp said its board declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding common share payable to holders of record April 9. The rights, which will expire 10 years later, will entitle shareholders to buy one-hundredth of a share of a new series of preferred at an exercise price of 20 dlrs. The rights will be exercisable only if some one acquires 30 pct or more of Centronic's common or announces an offer which would result in ownership of 30 pct or more of the stock. Centronics said its board will be entitled to redeem the rights at two cts per right at any time before a 30 pct position has been acquired. If the rights become exercisable, the company said, those held by shareholders other than the owner of 30 pct or more of the stock will entitle the holder to purchase a number of common shares having a market value twice the right's exercise price.

INDONESIA URGED TO DEREGULATE ITS ECONOMY World Bank President Barber Conable linked increased borrowing by Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest debtor, to fresh measures to deregulate trade and dismantle protectionist barriers. "We would like to see the Indonesian government continue the adjustment process ... To move towards increased deregulation of the economy," Conable told a press conference at the end of a three-day visit to Jakarta. Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia's hard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency. The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr trade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on the economic policies Indonesia adopted. But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific policy changes. "The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian government. We are not here to dictate to them," he stated. Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badly hit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenues from crude exports in half. Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning with Suharto. He voiced support for measures already taken, including September's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts to deregulate imports and stimulate exports. "The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of today's world," he said. The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the past 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year. The World Bank would probably like to see further dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce Indonesia's protected monopolies in areas like steel, plastics and cement, western bankers and diplomats said. The government has already said it will announce further deregulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is also considering selling off loss-making state companies. Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find funds to cover its share of development projects, which otherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed. Japan's Ex-Im bank announced a 900 mln dlr untied credit last month.

ZAIRE ACCEPTS TIN-EXPORT QUOTA, ATPC SAYS Zaire agreed to limit its tin exports to 1,736 tonnes for 12 months from March 1 in line with an Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) plan to curb exports, the ATPC said. ATPC Executive Director Victor Siaahan told Reuters he received a telex from Zaire indicating its willingess to take part in the plan to limit total ATPC exports to 96,000 tonnes for a year from March 1. Siaahan said Zaire is expected to produce 1,900 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987, and that in 1986 its output and exports were about 1,200 tonnes. The ATPC hopes to cut the 70,000-tonne world surplus by 20,000 tonnes and boost prices. All ATPC members except Zaire and Australia recently agreed to adhere to the export quotas allocated them under the plan. Australia said its quota of 7,000 tonnes was roughly equal to its expected output this year. The ATPC consists of Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Bolivia, Australia, Nigeria and Zaire. China and Bolivia, important producers of tin, are not members.  
CORRECTED - BANKAMERICA NEGOTIATING UNITS SALE Bank of America NT and SA's &lt;BAC.N> West German branch said it is negotiating the sale of Bankhaus Centrale Credit AG, a small local West German bank it acquired in 1965, and of its West German Visa credit card operation. Michael Seibel, Bank of America vice-president and regional manager, said the negotiations were proceeding well. He declined to give further details. Bank of America's West German branch lost some 32 mln marks in 1985. The result includes profit and loss transfers from Bankhaus Centrale Credit and the Visa organisation. The sale of the units is part of the bank's worldwide restructuring plan. -- corrects year of loss in third paragraph in item which originally ran February 27.  
MALAYSIAN 1987 ECONOMIC GROWTH SEEN ABOVE FORECAST The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd (DBS) said Malaysia's real gross domestic product growth (gdp) in 1987 could be 1.5 to two pct, above a budget target of one pct. It said in a report that because of an economic recovery and higher foreign exchange reserves, the Malaysian ringgit is unlikely to face devaluation in the near future. The report was presented at a two-day investment conference organised by the DBS, one of Singapore's four major banks. The report said rising commodity prices and the continued expansion of the manufacturing sector coupled with rigorous fiscal restraints and a more stable currency are grounds for cautious optimism about the Malaysian economy. It forecast the ringgit will remain stable at between 2.60 and 2.70 Malaysian dlrs to the U.S. Dollar for the rest of the year. But the report said the growth rate of Malaysia's external debt remains worrying and should be controlled. It said Malaysia's external debt totals 48 to 49 billion Malaysian dlrs and its debt service ratio exceeds 20 pct.  
FED EXPECTED TO TAKE NO MONEY MARKET ACTION The Federal Reserve is expected to refrain from reserve-management intervention in the U.S. Government securities market, economists said. If the Fed does act, however, they said it would be likely to add temporary reserves indirectly by arranging around 1.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements. Federal funds, which averaged 5.97 pct yesterday, opened at six pct and remained there in early trading.  
NORANDA MINE SEEN BELOW FULL OUTPUT FOR MONTHS Noranda Inc said production will remain shut down at its fire-damaged copper mine here until it can completely examine the mine. If it decides to keep the mine open it would take four or five months before it could resume full production. Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation could take from a few days to several weeks but would not be more specific. Noranda said when it resumes production it plans to operate the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 tonnes annual finished capacity. The fire, which started Wednesday and burned itself out late yesterday weakened part of the mine's support structure, Coffin said. One miner was killed and 56 others were trapped underground for about 24 hours before being brought safely out.  
USDA'S AMSTUTZ "SYMPATHETIC" TO WOOD CREDITS U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said he was "totally sympathetic" with U.S. wood producers' desire to have their exports eligible for government credit guarantees. But he told the Senate Appropriations Agriculture subcommittee that including wood products in the department's short- or intermediate-term export guarantee programs would conflict with U.S. multilateral trade obligations. Currently, U.S. wood products are not eligible for government export credit guarantee because they are considered "manufactured products," Amstutz said. He said USDA had devoted an "enormous amount" of time to considering making wood products eligible for the guarantees and that Congress was considering a measure to do so.

CANADA GDP RISES 3.1 PCT IN 1986 Canada's real gross domestic product, seasonally adjusted, rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, the same as the growth as in the previous quarter, Statistics Canada said. That left growth for the full year at 3.1 pct, which is down from 1985's four pct increase. The rise was also slightly below the 3.3 pct growth rate Finance Minister Michael Wilson predicted for 1986 in February's budget. He also forecast GDP would rise 2.8 pct in 1987. Statistics Canada said final domestic demand rose 0.6 pct in the final three months of the year after a 1.0 pct gain in the third quarter. Business investment in plant and equipment rose 0.8 pct in the fourth quarter, partly reversing the cumulative drop of 5.8 pct in the two previous quarters.  
KRUPP TO BUILD SOUTH KOREAN STEEL PLANT Fried. Krupp GmbH said its Krupp Industrietechnik GmbH subsidiary has won a 130 mln marks joint order with Samsung Shipbuilding and Heavy Industries Co.

The consortium partners will supply the plant, supervise its construction and advise on product processing, with Krupp providing a 100-tonne capacity arc furnace and a converter for steel refining. The West German company will supply ladles, vehicles, electrical and exhaust cooling apparatus and dust filters. It will also fit out the plant's laboratory. Among other things Krupp said it will provide know-how for all production phases and train the Korean workforce. It said Samsung will take care of the Korean part of the engineering and electrical work, the water treatment and other mechanical equipment, according to Krupp basic engineering.

BRAZIL COFFEE EXPORTS DISRUPTED BY STRIKE An 11-day-old strike by Brazilian seamen is affecting coffee shipments and could lead to a short term supply squeeze abroad, exporters said. They could not quantify how much coffee has been delayed but said at least 40 pct of coffee exports are carried by Brazilian ships and movement of foreign vessels has also been disrupted by port congestion caused by the strike. A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meant Brazil's coffee exports have been running at an average two weeks behind schedule since the start of the year, one source added. By the end of February shipments had fallen 800,000 bags behind registrations, leaving around 2.4 mln bags to be shipped during March. By March 10 only 230,000 bags had been shipped, the sources said. Given Brazil's port loading capacity of around 100,000 bags a day, even if normal operations were resumed immediately and not interrupted by bad weather, some March registered coffee will inevitably be shipped during April, they added.

LEADING COCOA PRODUCERS DISCUSS INTERNATIONAL PACT Leading cocoa producers will discuss whether newly-agreed rules on an international cocoa buffer stock will succeed in reversing a sharp fall in world prices when they start four day's of talks here later today, conference sources said. Another topic likely to be discussed at the twice-yearly meeting of the Cocoa Producer Alliance (CPA) is the pact's second line of market support -- a witholding scheme under which exporters can take up to 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if buffer stock purchases fail to defend prices. The International Cocoa Organisation is due to discuss the scheme at a meeting in June, and exporters could use the Yaounde talks to work out a common position on the issue, the sources said.

AVON PRODUCTS &lt;AVP> SEES HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS Avon Products Inc, the diversifed conglomerate that had a strong turn around in 1986, said it expects sales and earnings to climb higher this year. In its annual report, the company also said it expects to maintain its current annual two dlr dividend on the basis of continued upward earnings. In 1986, Avon's operational earnings rose 24 pct to 158.7 mln dlrs from 128.2 mln dlrs a year earlier, and sales rose 17 pct to 2.88 billion dlrs. It said the 2.23 dlrs a share earned last year was the highest in five years, but still well below the company's all-time high of 4.06 dlrs a share in 1979.

GERMAN BANK SEES HIGHER GOLD PRICE FOR 1987 Gold is expected to continue its rise this year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially in the U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said. It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oil prices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' efforts to achieve further firming of the price led to growing inflationary pressures in the U.S., The world's biggest crude oil producer. Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceed the central banks' limits and real growth of their gross national products, it said. Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank said. Speculative demand, which influences the gold price on futures markets, has also risen. These factors and South Africa's unstable political situation, which may lead to a temporary reduction in gold supplies from that country, underline the firmer sentiment, it said. However, Australia's output is estimated to rise to 90 tonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986.

TREASURY'S BAKER SEES CUT IN TRADE DEFICIT Treasury Secretary James Baker said the administration is confident the effect of exchange rate changes will bring about a cut in the trade deficit this year. In testimony before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Baker conceded that the effect thus far has "not yet proved as quick or as strong as had been expected from past experience." He told the committee, however, that the "initial signs are encouraging."  
U.K. RESERVES SHOW UNDERLYING RISE IN FEBRUARY Britain's gold and currency reserves showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a 72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said. The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of borrowings and repayments. This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise. The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest. Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26 billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion. Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a Treasury spokesman said. Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January, capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund swap. The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's market operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound today. A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures, said that the government does not want sterling either to rise too far or to fall substantially from current levels. He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting.  
CBT DISCUSSES MAJOR CHANGES FOR RENOVATION Chicago Board of Trade (CBT) agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for a period of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goes ahead with planned renovation. A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at a number of options to identify the most cost effective and efficient way to proceed, including one which would involve moving the entire grains floor out of the building and into the nearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange. "One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann's agenda items has been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room," the spokesman said. Another CBT official, executive vice president George Sladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a special meeting on the exchange floor. A number of presentations have been made with regard to renovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. "We've looked at five or six different alternatives, involving such things as flip-flopping the trading rooms," he added. It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, we might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT markets, Sladoje said. "If we move out of one floor entirely, then the construction period will be about a year," he said, adding that the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then be on the drawing board for eight months to a year. The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until this summer at the earliest. In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits, exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary home next door in the present grains-dominated area. This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bond futures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds and T-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing the MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options. Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT members. One senior floor trader said the financial futures room badly needs renovating. "There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and the financials will move to the grains area," he said. The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was to renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at a time. "The first step, after deciding the most effective way to proceed, would be to get architectural and engineering drawings," he said. He added that it was difficult at present to determine an exact time frame for any possible moves. "This is a major undertaking and a process that would spread out over next year," he said. Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, which merged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparing to vacate their floor at the end of this month. Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT by moving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reserved for lightly-traded CBT gold and silver futures, which now share their trading area. The MidAm specializes in mini-contracts in grains, livestock, metals, financials and foreign currencies as well as some options contracts. "Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over here because the bonds are too crowded," one MidAm trader said. Another source at the MidAm said this change could take place by July or August.  
CYCLOPS &lt;CYL> SAYS DIXONS AGREEMENTS BINDING Cyclops Corp said that as it has already stated, its agreements with &lt;Dixons Group PLC> are binding and Dixons will not rescind or waive any provisions of the agreements. The company said its agreement to merge into Dixons does not permit it to provide nonpublic information to &lt;CYACQ>, which is making a competing offer for Cyclops, that had been provided to Dixons. It said other provisions Dixons will not waive include its rights to recover breakup fees or expenses from Cyclops or buy Cyclops common shares from Cyclops. Cyclops noted that Dixons' waiver of rights to breakup fees or the purchase of common stock directly from Cyclops and the provision of nonpublic information to CYACQ are conditions to CYACQ's increased 92.50 dlr per share offer to acquire Cyclops shares. Dixons is tendering for Cyclops shares at 90.25 dlrs a share.  Yesterday Citicorp &lt;CCI>, with Audio/Video Affiliates Inc &lt;AVA> an owner of CYACQ, said it had offered to acquire from Dixons after the merger of Cyclops into Dixons Cyclops' industrial businesses for 12.8 mln dlrs more than Alleghany Corp &lt;Y> is currently scheduled to pay for them. Citicorp said yesterday that its proposal would allow Dixons to raise its tender price to 93.25 dlrs per share. Citicorp said if Dixons accepted the proposal, CYACQ would terminate its competing offer for Cyclops.

API PRESIDENT SEES OPTIONS TO AVERT OIL CRISIS American Petroleum Institute President Charles DiBona said no options should be rejected to combat growing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. "No action should be ruled out--import fees or quotas, floor prices, tax incentives or other alternatives--while a national dialogue on the issue continues," DiBona said at a paper institute conference in New York today. DiBona said there is no unanimity within the industry on how to stimulate energy production but there is consensus on removing several government policies that hinder investments in new prospects. DiBona said the windfall profit tax should be abolished immediately and current proposals for increased environmental regulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be not adopted. He also suggested that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oil companies, DiBona said. "This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the nation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil," DiBona said. Since 1986 U.S. oil production has fallen while consumption rose and that has raised dependence on imported oil, particularly from OPEC, DiBona said.

HOUSE SPEAKER BACKS OIL IMPORT FORECAST PLAN House Speaker Jim Wright endorsed a proposal to require the president to take action to reduce oil imports if they threaten to top 50 pct of U.S. consumption. Wright told reporters the plan by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a fellow Texas Democrat, was positive and useful. Oil imports peaked in 1977 at 47 pct, were short of 36 pct last year and this year are up over 40 pct, Bentsen said. The Bentsen proposal, supported by 24 other Senators, would would require the president to issue annual three-year oil import forecasts. In any year they threatened to top 50 pct, he would be ordered to propose quotas or other solution.

BANK OF JAPAN CALLS FOR LONG-TERM EFFORTS ON TRADE The short-term effect of foreign exchange rate movements in correcting international trade imbalances appears to be waning, and long-term efforts are required to cut Japan's chronic dependence on external demand, the Bank of Japan said in a monthly report. Japan's trade surplus in nominal terms is likely to remain high in the near future, the central bank said. Fundamental adjustments will be needed as long as Japan hopes to benefit from a better international allocation of resources and maintain the free trade system, it added.  
BANK SEES MODEST RECOVERY IN GULF ARAB ECONOMIES The Emirates Industrial Bank has predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states following higher oil revenues. A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from 33.5 billion in 1986. The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain overall group production. These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs. "All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years," the study said. It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts. The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year. It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985. The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product to 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, it added.

JAPAN CANNOT BEAR FURTHER YEN RISE, MINISTER SAYS Japan cannot bear a further rise of the yen, Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said. "A further stronger yen would be a misfortune for Japan and the Japanese people would not be able to bear such a burden," he told reporters. The minister said he wants to tell U.S. Political leaders of the sacrifices Japan is making to cut its trade surplus. Kuranari was widely expected to fly to Washington tomorrow for talks focussing on trade. But departure remains uncertain because of the continuing parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting plans for a new sales tax. If the boycott is lifted tomorrow, Kuranari would probably have to remain in Japan to attend parliamentary discussions on the government's 1987/88 budget, Japanese officials said. Kuranari said both the U.S. And Japan should approach the trade imbalance in a calm, unemotional manner. But, he added, "If the issue of rice is to be raised...I would mention the feelings of the Japanese people." Japanese politicians have said repeatedly the country cannot bow to U.S. Pressure to liberalize rice imports because the issue is too sensitive.

TRITON ENERGY &lt;OIL> AFFILIATE IN CANADIAN FIND Triton Energy Corp said its 70 pct owned &lt;Canadian Worldwide Energy Ltd> affiliate's Lasmo et al Tableland 4-36-2-10W2 well in Saskatchewan flowed 567 barrels of 37 degree gravity oil through a 17/64 inch choke from depths of 8,531 to 8,548 feet and 636 barrels of oil per day through a 20/64 inch choke from depths of 8,500 to 8,507 feet. Triton said because of the well's status as a deep exploratory well, production qualifies for a five-year royalty holiday under the Saskatchewan drilling incentive products. It said the well's initial production is expected to be restricted to an allowable level of about 300 barrels a day, although it is capable of sustaining much higher rates.

GULF STATES (GSU) SEES END TO CASH BY MAY Gulf States Utilities Co said its condition has "significantly deteriorated" and that its operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless it receives additional financing or rate relief from state public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana. In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-K filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the utility last month that no additional credit would be granted. Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs. "The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company may have to seek protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy code," Gulf States said. The utility had previously said it might be forced to consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf States' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana. "If the regulatory commissions approve the company's proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period, the company believes it could achieve financial stability," Gulf States said. In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of credit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1 mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas. Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in emergency rate relief. In 1986, Gulf States earned 244.9 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.47 billion dlrs, compared to profits of 265.4 mln dlrs on sales of 1.85 billion in the previous year.

CBT TRADERS SAY U.S. CONSERVATION SIGNUP NEUTRAL The 11,254,837 acres of highly erodable farmland submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the conservation reserve program was within trade guesses of 10-12 mln and should have an overall neutral impact on grain and soybean prices Monday, grain traders said. Farmers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in the conservation program to take advantage of a corn bonus rental payment that was offered by the USDA, which may underpin new crop futures, they said. New crop corn prices firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program. But traders noted that the poor yielding acres being set-aside will result in only a modest decrease in final production figures, since farmers will concentrate on high yielding land. Of a total 11,254,837 erodoble acres submitted, usda accepted 10,572,402 acres into the program at an average rental payment of 51.17 dlrs per acre. Farm land signed up to date now totals 19,488,587 acres.

CARLING O'KEEFE&lt;CKB> SELLS OIL UNIT, TAKES GAIN Carling O'Keefe Ltd said it sold its Star Oil and Gas Ltd unit to United Coal (Canada) Ltd for about 57 mln dlrs cash. Carling said it will record an extraordinary gain of about two mln dlrs after tax, or nine cts a common share resulting from the sale. The company did not elaborate further on financial terms. A Carling official later said in reply to an inquiry that Carling would record the extraordinary gain in its fourth quarter ending March 31. The move came after Carling's 50 pct-owner &lt;Rothmans Inc> agreed last week to sell its Carling stake to &lt;Elders IXL Ltd>, of Australia, for 196.2 mln Canadian dlrs.  
E.F. HUTTON &lt;EFH> STARTS PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> BID E.F. Hutton Group Inc said it has started its previously announced offer to purchase up to 6,332,471 common shares of Purolator Courier Corp at 35 dlrs each. In a newspaper advertisement, the company said the offer, proration period and withdrfawal rights will expire April One unless extended.  The offer is conditioned on receipt of at least 5,116,892 Purolator shares, or a 66.7 pct interest, and is the first step in a merger agreement that has been approved by the Purolator board. Hutton said it reserves the right to buy more than 6,332,471 shares but has no present intention of doing so.  It said it may waive the condition that at least 5,116,892 shares be tendered as long as it received at least a 50.1 pct interest.  If it were to receive fewer shares than that, it said it would only purchase sharesd with the consent of Purolator.  
AKZO PLANNING US INVESTMENTS Dutch chemicals group Akzo NV &lt;AKZO.AS> said it hoped to consolidate its core activities this year by making small acquisitions in the US. Akzo chairman Aarnoud Loudon told a news conference on its 1986 report that the company wanted to achieve the same level of US investments it had before it divested its fibre firm American Enka in December 1985, when US investments represented 20 pct of Akzo's total capital. The US expansion plans were not an attempt to compensate for losses in guilder income through the lower dollar, Loudon said. He said a more important factor was the speed of growth in the US, adding "It's the largest industrial market in the world." But he said the company would also be looking at possible acquisitions in Europe. Despite its highly liquid cash flow, Akzo did not plan acquisitions on a scale that would negatively influence the company's debt/equity ratio, Loudon said. The chairman said in the past two years Akzo had spent 1.1 billion guilders on acquisitions, of which nearly two thirds were in the United States. REUTER...  
GERMAN BANKING AUTHORITIES WEIGH SWAP REGULATIONS German banking authorities are weighing rules for banks' off-balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments, banking sources said. Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. To Japan. Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank's division of banking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-British proposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate. But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals. "There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latter stages," one representative of the German Banking Association in Cologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year. All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, West Germany's four major banking associations and the Federal Banking Supervisory Office. Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of Germany's credit law, which has been in effect since 1934. Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it, banking sources said. Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited banks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves, on a consolidated basis. But lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts, currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs, currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges. The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor, and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps. But even if German banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk. U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous. This is the so-called market-to-market value. But German authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved, the sources said. The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for public authorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers. A further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put German banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said. Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S. And British authorities, the sources said. One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated foreign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be brought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different. How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead-manage mark eurobonds. But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement, particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet, the sources added.

HORIZ0N AGREES TO 94.8 MLN STG BID FROM BASS Bass Plc &lt;BASS.L> and &lt;Horizon Travel Plc> said terms have been agreed for an offer worth around 94.8 mln stg for Horizon by Bass. The offer values each Horizon share at some 0.213 of a Bass ordinary share, or 190p. This is based on a price of 892p, the Bass share quotation at 1630 gmt on April 2. Horizon said its board and financial advisers consider the offer to be fair and reasonable and the board will unanimously recommend acceptance to its shareholders. Horizon shares jumped 23p to 188 after the announcement while Bass shares dipped 13p to 879. Bass has for some time regarded overseas holidays as an area for expansion and in pursuit of this objective, acquired a 25.6 pct holding in Horizon in 1985 when it set up the jointly owned hotel company. Both Bass and Horizon said that Bass's resources will enable Horizon's businesses to expand strongly this year. On March 30 Bass said it had agreed to sell its Pontins U.K. Holiday camps to a newly formed private company, Pontins Ltd, for some 57.5 mln stg.  
USDA RAISES SOVIET GRAIN IMPORT ESTIMATE The U.S. Agriculture Department increased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from last month's projection of 23 mln tonnes. In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA said the increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the U.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and coarse grain from other major suppliers. USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up one mln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below the preliminary 1985/86 figure. Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mln tonnes. Record or near-record livestock inventories, along with a dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and a cold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said. USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightly from the previous January's level, while milk production increased by nearly six pct. Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases in roughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestock production from expanding as much as it did a year earlier, USDA said.

EC TO BOOST SPENDING ON JOB CREATION THIS YEAR The European Community (EC) is to boost spending to help the jobless this year. The EC's executive commission said in a statement spending on its so-called social fund would rise to 3.1 billion European Currency Units from 2.5 billion ECUs in 1986. The fund is designed to help boost job creation and improve worker mobility, and supplement national schemes in the EC's 12 member states. Another 60 mln ECUs could be added if EC ministers switch unused project credits to other programs, the Commission said. Italy is the largest net beneficiary in 1987, getting 635 mln ECUs, with Britain in second place with 580 mln.

The net position of public authorities at the Bundesbank declined 6.7 billion marks in the last week of February. The federal government drew down 3.8 billion marks of its Bundesbank cash deposits, which had stood at 4.1 billion in the third week of February, and also borrowed a 1.8 billion in credit from the central bank. Federal states' deposits fell 1.5 billion marks to 1.3 billion and their cash credits dropped 400 mln to 300 mln.

JAPAN SLIGHTLY REDUCES SUGAR CONSUMPTION ESTIMATE The Agriculture Ministry said it revised its April-June sugar consumption estimate down to 623,300 tonnes on a refined basis, from 637,800 estimated at the end of December.

It did not revise its sugar consumption estimate of 2.53 mln tonnes for the 1986/87 sugar year ending September 30. The ministry said the estimate for the 1986/87 year's supply of domestically produced sugar was revised to 881,000 tonnes, from the earlier estimate of 863,000. The estimate for 1986/87 imports was revised to 1.642 mln tonnes, from an earlier 1.645 mln tonnes.

NORSTAR &lt;NOR>, FLEET &lt;FLT> OUTLINE MERGER Fleet Financial Group said that its board and the board of Norstar Bancorp have agreed to merge the two bank holding companies in a transaction which would create a 23 billion dlr asset bank holding company. Under terms of the transaction, each Norstar shareholder will receive 1.2 shares of Fleet common stock based on the number of Fleet shares after giving effect to a previously announced April one Fleet stock split. The two-for-one stock split will increase Fleet's currently 25.7 mln outstanding shares to 51.5 shares. There are about 34.9 mln Norstar shares outstanding. Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one 1988, the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's interstate banking law takes effect. For the full year ended december 31, Fleet, a Rhode Island based bank holding company, reported net income of 136.7 mln dlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. Norstar, an Albany N.y. holding company, reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and assets of 11.1 billion dlrs. Fleet comptroller Irv Goss said it is estimated that the transaction will result in minimal dilution in Fleet/Norstar earnings per share. It is the intention of both companies that cash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline for either company's stock holders, the company said. For 1986, Norstar issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash dividends on its common stock. Fleet's current annual distibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68 dlrs a share. In addition, Fleet and Norstar have each granted the other an option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued shares of common stock, that will constitute 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares outstanding. The transaction is subject to both regulatory and shareholder approval. The companies said that after the proposed merger, the combined banking holding wil be among the 25 largest in the country.  
IRELAND PUT ON COLORADO BEETLE ALERT The Irish Agriculture Department issued a Colorado beetle alert today after three of the beetles were found in a box of parsley imported from France.

Some of the 80 boxes in the parsley consignment had already been distributed to markets and the department called on all shopkeepers and the catering trade to be on the alert.  
SAUDI ARABIA REITERATES COMMITMENT TO OPEC ACCORD Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer reiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC accord to boost world oil prices and stabilize the market, the official Saudi Press Agency SPA said. Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia "is fully adhering by the ... accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance." Saudi Arabia was a main architect of December pact under which OPEC agreed to cut its total oil output ceiling by 7.25 pct and return to fixed prices of around 18 dollars a barrel.  
OECD JANUARY ANNUAL INFLATION STEADY AT 2.1 PCT Inflation in the 24 industrialised nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development was 2.1 pct in the year to January, unchanged from December, the OECD said. But monthly inflation throughout the OECD was an average 0.4 pct in January, a rise compared to the 0.2 pct in the last quarter. Retail energy prices rose strongly in January, reflecting the firming of world oil prices. For OECD states the increase was 0.7 pct but the January level of retail energy prices was still 11.6 pct lower than a year earlier, the OECD said. The increase in consumer prices excluding food and energy, at 0.4 pct in January for the whole OECD area, was unchanged on the four previous months, but over the year to January OECD consumer prices rose by 3.5 pct, against 3.3 pct in December. Unadjusted annual inflation for the seven leading industrialised nations in January was running at 4.4 pct in Italy, 3.9 pct in Britain and Canada, three pct in France, 1.4 pct in the U.S., Minus 0.8 pct in West Germany and minus 1.5 pct in Japan, the OECD said.

CARBIDE &lt;UK> LOOKS TO ACQUISITIONS FOR GROWTH Union Carbide Corp is looking to acquisitions and joint ventures to aid its chemicals and plastics growth, according the H.W. Lichtenberger, president of Chemicals and Plastics. Describing this as a major departure in the company's approach to commercial development, he told the annual new business forum of the Commercial Development Association "We are looking to acquisitions and joint ventures when they look like the fastest and most promising routes to the growth markets we've identified." Not very long ago Union Carbide had the attitude "that if we couldn't do it ourselves, it wasn't worth doing. Or, if it was worth doing, we had to go it alone," Lichtenberger explained. He said "there are times when exploiting a profitable market is done best with a partner. Nor do we see any need to plow resources into a technology we may not have if we can link up profitably with someone who is already there." He said Carbide has extended its catalyst business that way and is now extending its specialty chemicals business in the same way.

SUMITA SAYS HE DOES NOT EXPECT FURTHER DOLLAR FALL Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said he does not expect the dollar to remain unstable and fall further. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the Bank of Japan would continue to cooperate closely with other major nations to stabilize exchange rates. The central bank has been keeping extremely careful watch on exchange rate movements since last week, he said. He said the dollar would not continue to fall because of underlying market concern about the rapid rise of the yen. Sumita said the currency market has been reacting to overseas statements and to trade tension between Japan and the U.S. Over semiconductors. The yen's tendency to rise will prevent Japan from expanding domestic demand and undertaking necessary economic restructuring, he said.  
NATIONAL DATA &lt;NDAC> IN PACT WITH SIGNATURE National Data Communications Inc said it is no longer obligated to issue its majority shareholder &lt;Signature Capital Corp> 20 mln common shares under a previous agreement. National said it entered into a new agreement with Signature, which would have owned about 80 pct of National's common under the prior pact. Under the new pact, National said it granted Signature a five-year option to acquire two mln shares of its common for an option price equal to its current market value. National has about 15.3 mln shares outstanding.  
ALGERIA REGULATES USE OF COFFEE ADDITIVES The Algerian authorities have regulated the addition of chickpeas and barley used to make imported coffee go further, the official APS news agency reported. Taking advantage of scarcity, private roasters were selling ground coffee mixtures which were 75 pct non-coffee, it said. Since the beginning of March, the coffee market has been strictly regulated by the state food marketing monopoly Enapal. Now a third of imported coffee will be sold as pure beans and two thirds as a ground mixture with a choice of 30 pct chickpeas or 30 pct barley. In March private dealers will handle 2,050 tonnes of pure coffee and Enapal 6,050 tonnes of mixtures.

MARATHON PETROLEUM REDUCES CRUDE POSTINGS Marathon Petroleum Co said it reduced the contract price it will pay for all grades of crude oil one dlr a barrel, effective today. The decrease brings Marathon's posted price for both West Texas Intermediate and West Texas Sour to 16.50 dlrs a bbl. The South Louisiana Sweet grade of crude was reduced to 16.85 dlrs a bbl. The company last changed its crude postings on Jan 12.  
SOUTH KOREAN MONEY SUPPLY FALLS IN MARCH South Korea's M-2 money supply fell two pct to 33,463.4 billion won in March from 34,030.3 billion in February, provisional Bank of Korea figures show. It rose a revised 0.5 pct in February and was up 14.7 pct from a year earlier. M-1 money supply fell 8.7 pct to 7,767.8 billion won in March against a revised rise of 4.3 pct in February. It has increased 8.3 pct since March last year. Bank officials said the March falls were due mainly to various measures by the bank to absorb excess money.

HONDURAS AUTHORIZED TO BUY PL 480 COMMODITIES Honduras has been authorized to buy about 75,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat, about 15,000 tonnes of U.S. corn, and about 6,000 tonnes of U.S. tallow under an existing PL 480 agreement, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The department said it may buy the wheat, valued at 8.5 mln dlrs, the corn, valued at 1.5 mln, and the tallow, valued at 2.0 mln dlrs, between March 24 and August 31, 1987, and ship it from U.S. ports and/or Canadian transshipment points by this September 30. The purchase authorizations cover the entire quantity provided under the agreement, signed March 11.  
MIDMISSISSIPPI RIVER OPENS TODAY FOR SEASON The Mississippi River is now open for barge traffic up to the Twin Cities in Minnesota after repairs were completed and the first barges moved upstream through Lock and Dam 20 near Quincy, Ill at 0600 CST today, an Army Corps of Engineers spokesman said. About 14 to 15 inches of ice were reported between locks three and four on the upper Mississippi River, but other sections were generally free of ice, the spokesman said. Midwestern weather has been so mild that barges probably could have kept loading at Mid-Mississippi River terminals through the winter, if Lock and Dam 20 had not been scheduled for repairs, he said. The Peoria and La Grange locks on the Illinois River are still scheduled to close July 13, for two months of repairs.

CURRENCY INTERVENTION TIMING CRUCIAL - ANALYSTS The dollar's recent decline, despite massive central bank purchases, is a forceful reminder that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment, dealers and analysts said. Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend, but, without accompanying policy changes, they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an ever-growing global market in which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day, the sources said. "Timing and psychology are the key to successful intervention," said Jim O'Neill, a financial markets economist with Marine Midland Banks Inc. The importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when a change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a week through open market intervention. After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to 7-3/4 pct, the first change in the rate since last August, the dollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 147.50 yen, up two yen from Tuesday's New York low. By contrast, monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank of Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion dlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low Monday of 144.70 yen. Some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar. The market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a central bank foray, but is no longer mesmerized. "They've lost their credibility. The market feels it can take on the central banks and win," said Michael Snow, head of treasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks scored when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the September 22, 1985, Plaza accord. Then, however, central banks had an easy time of it, because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances. Now, there is no such consensus. The market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the U.S. trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement, while Japan is resisting in a bid to protect its export industries. For its part, the United States is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group of Five plus Canada to foster stability, dealers say. Specifically, they said the Fed's dollar-buying intervention has been half-hearted, designed more as a political gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the markets. "It's been pro-forma intervention," said Francoise Soares-Kemp, chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais. Because of this discord and the market's momentum for a lower dollar, analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail. "It's going to take a lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar (at these levels)," said Snow, who predicts another 10 to 15 pct depreciation. "There have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars," added "Buying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it." Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack, central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to a record low of 1.70 marks, analysts said. Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely. "I don't think anybody has the stomach for it, because they saw the futility of it in the seventies." Indeed, because the market has grown in leaps and bound since then, intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to impress the market. Trading volume in London, New York and Tokyo alone last year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day, according to a joint central bank study, about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private research group. There are signs that central banks, too, realize the futility of swimming against the tide. Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for bolstering the dollar, such as invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks, are being considered. "In this era of financial liberalization, it's almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan," one senior official in Tokyo said.  
BAKER DENIES DOLLAR TARGET EXISTS U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker again said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month did not establish a target exchange rate for the dollar. Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday: "We don't have a target for the dollar." He declined to comment on what might be a desired level for the dollar, saying: "We really don't talk about the dollar." He said protectionism was becoming "extremely strong" in the U.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and import barriers in other countries. "The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing. It's extremely strong," he said. "As I've said before, we sort of see ourselves as engaged here in a real struggle to preserve the world's free trading system, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.) goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path that the world did in the late 1930s," he said. While relative exchange rates had a role to play in defusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offer any solution, he said. "You must address this problem on the exchange rate side, but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It's far more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution of it requires a comprehensive approach," Baker said in the interview. Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to adjust their currencies upwards, as well as remove their barriers to U.S. Imports. But he did not elaborate or name any countries.  
JAPAN CAREFULLY CONSIDERING MONEY POLICY -- SUMITA Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank will carefully consider its monetary policy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar. Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut in its discount rate, he said he now thinks the bank will have to carefully consider its future money policy. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that credit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate cuts by Japan since the beginning of last year. Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up in inflation, with money supply growth accelerating, he said. Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices, exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in and outside Japan. Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure because the dollar had fallen too far, Sumita said he still thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had corrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accord did not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said. The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief that the trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said.  
U.S. PRODUCER PRICES RISE 0.1 PCT IN FEBRUARY The U.S. Producer Price Index for finished goods rose 0.1 pct on a seasonally adjusted basis in February, the Labor Department said. The increase came after a 0.6 pct increase in producer prices in January. Higher energy prices were primarily responsible for the increase in February, though they rose at a slower pace than they had in January, the department said. The finished goods index was up 0.1 pct from its February, 1986 level. Before seasonal adjustment, the index for finished goods stood at 292.3 over its 1967 base of 100. Among finished goods, the index for energy products rose four pct in February after a 9.8 pct increase in January. But price increases slowed sharply for gasoline and home heating oil, the department said. There were some price declines, including a 3.4 pct fall for passenger cars and 1.3 pct for light trucks from January levels. This reflected expanded factory-financed rebates and discount loan programs, the department said. Before seasonal adjustment, the index for finished goods stood at 292.3 over its 1967 base of 100.

This reflected expanded factory-financed rebates and discount loan programs, the department said. The index for consumer foods fell 0.5 pct after a 1.8 pct drop in January as vegetables, pork and coffee cost less. The index for intermediate goods rose 0.5 pct following a sharp 0.9 pct rise in January. The department said that energy prices again were the main reason, with the index for intermediate energy up 2.7 pct. Gasoline and diesel fuel prices were about five pct higher, half the 10 pct jump recorded in January. The durable manufacturing materials index edged down 0.1 pct last month after jumping 1.0 pct in January as prices for steel, precious metals and copper stabilized. The department said lead and zinc prices fell, while hardwood lumber and cement cost more. The crude materials index rose 1.8 pct in February after a 2.9 pct rise in January. Crude energy materials were up 2.6 pct, much less than the 10 pct rise in January. Crude petroleum prices rose 4.4 pct last month after a sharp 19.7 pct rise in January. Price rises accellerated for logs and timber and tobacco, but fell for cotton, metal ores and copper and aluminum scrap. Among finished goods, gasoline rose 5.5 pct after a 15.7 pct January increase, and fuel oil was up three pct in February after an 18.0 pct increase in January.  
ROCHESTER TELEPHONE &lt;RTC> TO BUY CANTON PHONE Rochester Telephone Corp said it agreed to buy &lt;Canton Telephone Co> for undisclosed terms. Canton serves customers in northeastern Penn. In 1986, it had operating revenues of about 1.3 mln dlrs, the company said.

CANADA BUILDING PERMITS RISE IN NOVEMBER Led by the non-residential sector, Canadian building permits issued in November rose 0.7 pct to 2.18 billion dlrs, seasonally adjusted, from 2.16 billion dlrs in October, Statistics Canada said. Residential permits fell 3.9 pct to 1.25 billion dlrs from 1.30 billion dlrs in October while the number of units approved fell to 17,552 from 19,079 units. The value of non-residential projects rose 7.6 pct to 927.6 mln dlrs in the month.  
ESTIMATED FRENCH BARLEY STOCKS WORRYING - ONIC The size of French 1986/87 carryover barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with 700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said. He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the end of February from the previous month while export forecasts were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86. Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are opened for French barley a large amount could be put into intervention. A small amount of French barley has already been put into intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount. The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000 tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in 1985/86. The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision to hold special export tenders for French maize, he said.

NESTLE SEEKING AUTHORISATION FOR CERTIFICATE ISSUE Nestle SA &lt;NESZ.Z> said it would seek shareholder approval to issue participation certificates up to 20 pct of share capital, instead of the current limit of 10 pct. It said it wanted this authorisation in view of future certificate issues. Nestle's nominal capital amounts to 330 mln Swiss francs. Nestle reported net profits of 1.79 billion francs for 1986, up 2.2 pct from 1985, while turnover fell 9.9 pct to 38.05 billion as the Swiss franc strengthened against other currencies. The parent company's net profit rose to 666.6 mln francs from 592.9 mln in 1985, and the company planned an unchanged dividend of 145 francs per share and 29 francs per certificate after placing 170 mln francs in reserves, against 95 mln last year. The payout represented 27.6 pct of group net profit, against 28.2 pct last year. Nestle said it had also invited Fritz Leutwiler, former president of the Swiss National Bank and currently chairman of BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie &lt;BBCZ.Z>, to join the Nestle board.  
FRANCE TO REQUEST PERMANENT MAIZE REBATES French maize producers will ask the EC Commission to grant permanent maize export rebates following the recent EC/U.S. Accord guaranteeing the U.S. An annual export quota of two mln tonnes of maize for Spain over four years, the French maize producers association, AGPM, said. The Commission has already decided to accord rebates for the export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize, of which rebates for around 100,000 tonnes have been granted. The request will be made when export certificates have been granted for all the 500,000 tonnes, the AGPM said. The association said that the request would cover exports to all destinations, adding that the Soviet Union, which has important maize needs, is currently excluded from the list of destination countries for the 500,000 tonnes of French maize. The U.S. Agriculture Department has forecast Soviet maize imports for the 1986/87 campaign at 4.90 mln tonnes against 10.40 mln in 1985/86.  
LONDON SUGAR OPENS STEADY BUT QUIET Raw sugar futures had a quiet opening call of 38 lots with prices holding steady from last night with gains of 20 to 80 cents a tonne, dealers said. Aug was trading at 157.60 dlrs from 157.40 asked yesterday. The modest rise continued the recent rally from an oversold situation but, dealers noted, there was little fresh physicals news to stimulate activity. Whites tenders are scheduled for next Wednesday by Syria for 36,000 tonnes and Greece for 40,000 tonnes while Pakistan is due to tender on April 11 for 100,000 tonnes whites, they said. This week has seen whites buying by India and Egypt.  
BANK OF ENGLAND LENDS ONE BILLION STG AT 10 PCT The Bank of England said it had lent one billion stg to the discount market for fourteen days at 10 pct. This brings the Banks total help today to some 1.34 billion stg and satisfies the estimated shortage in the system today which it had earlier estimated at 1.3 billion stg. The Bank's announcement this morning that it was willing to lend two-week money at 10 pct was interpreted by the market as a sanction for lower U.K. Base lending rates. The U.K. Clearing banks swiftly took this up, cutting their base rates by a half-point to 10 pct. At midday, the central bank lowered its money market dealing rates by the same amount.  
BANK OF JAPAN SATISFIED WITH YEN AT CURRENT RANGE The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range, a senior central bank official told reporters. He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar rise. Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks, he said. The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but declined to be more specific. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy. Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S. Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down. The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little changed from the performance expected this year. Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of nearly one percentage point, he said. He said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added. The central bank's monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said. The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half. Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said. "We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may still be wet," he added. Liquidity among private households and especially the corporate sector has increased substantially, he said. The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock exchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may continue, he said. The senior official said the Bank of Japan is hoping Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker will be re-appointed when his current term expires later this year. "He's a great man," the official said, adding that more and more people expect his reappointment. Turning to exchange rates, the official said the substantial drop in the dollar is beginning to have an effect on reducing the imbalance in world trade, even though the impact has taken longer than expected to show through. Even the U.S. Trade position has begun to feel the impact, although so far it has not been very strong, he said.

FAIRCHILD DEAL FAILURE SEEN MAKING JAPANESE WARY Schlumberger Ltd's &lt;SLB.N> decision to end an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> to buy 80 pct of its &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>, and the political furore that surrounded the proposed sale, will make Japanese companies more cautious in their efforts to acquire U.S. High technology firms but will not halt such attempts, industry analysts said. The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to Fujitsu but it will boost the cost of future U.S. Expansion by the Japanese firm, said analysts polled by Reuters. "The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu's North American operations, but it would have been a great boost," James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said. French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was ending the agreement because mounting political controversy in the U.S. Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake could be completed in a reasonable time. The sale was opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and Defence Department, partly on national security grounds. Fujitsu's acquisition of Fairchild would have given the Japanese computer maker control of a comprehensive North American sales and distribution system and access to microprocessor technology, an area where Fujitsu is weak, analysts said. The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additional microchip production facilities worldwide, eight of them in the U.S., A report by the Capel firm said. "It was an entry point, a port for semiconductors and a marketing channel for other things," said Barclays de Zoete Wedd analyst Rick May. Several analysts said the purchase would not have given Fujitsu access to critical defence technology. "(Fairchild) simply doesn't have key technology -- that's a thing of the past," May said. The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu as it might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to modernise Fairchild's production lines, Capel's Murtha said. The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanese firms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire U.S. High tech firms but they are unlikely to stop, analysts said. Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costly route of expanding its own production and distribution facilities in the U.S., Although some said it could use the estimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try to acquire some less politically symbolic firm. "It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions, but the necessity of expanding their production and design capacity in America remains," said Capel's Murtha. "The Japanese will continue to shop for bargains, but it will be harder to find ones that are politically acceptable." Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or smaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash that blocked the Fairchild sale, analysts said. "They're not going to slow up, they're just going to buy smaller pieces ... Because of the political risk," said Barclays de Zoete's May. Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pct shares in smaller U.S. High technology firms such as super minicomputer makers, he said. Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end up harming U.S. Firms and undermining a trend toward multinational tie-ups, some analysts said. "This is not really of benefit to U.S. Firms either," said Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. "The pooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move -- why should the government step in to prevent it?" Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry Hajime Tamura told a press conference that interference by U.S. Government officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate. "This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matter for governments' comment," Tamura said. "I think it was improper for U.S. Government officials to intervene to the extent they did," he said. A spokesman told Reuters the ministry's view is that international investment flows ought to be free and that such flows are of increasing importance in line with the growing closeness of U.S.-Japanese economic ties.

RECOMMENDATION REITERATED ON WANG LABS &lt;WANB> Analyst Thomas McCrann of Merrill Lynch said he reiterated a "buy" recommendation of Wang Laboratories Inc, noting that a successful cost cutting campaign could reduce the earnings loss expected for the third quarter ending in March. Wang was the most actively traded stock on the American Stock Exchange, rising 3/4 to 16-5/8. McCrann said that "Wang is a little bit ahead of where they were expected to be in their cost reductions, and as a result, the odds have increased that the loss for the quarter will be less than had been expected." McCrann said he expects Wang to report break even earnings per share or only a small loss per share for the third quarter. He said for the year, however, the company should report a loss of about 50 cts a share compared with earnings of about 35 cts a share a year ago.

WALL STREET STOCKS/AMES DEPT STORES &lt;ADD> Ames Department Stores Inc fell 1-7/8 to 23 in what analysts said was a reaction to a surprise announcement earlier today by the company that earnings in the fiscal year ended January 31 will decline sharply. Ames said it expects to report earnings of between 72 and 77 cts per share compared with 1.19 dlrs per share in the previous year. "We were looking for 1.15 dlrs," said an analyst at a major Wall Street firm who declined to be identified. Ames said most of the decline resulted from an inventory shortage at its Secaucus, N.J. distribution center. "The obvious suspicion is that there has been some kind of fraud or theft," said Ralph Shulansky, senior vice president of Ames. "We do not have hard evidence we are still putting things together." He said it would take several weeks for the company to complete an investigation. He said there are no law enforcement officials involved at this time. He declined to quantify the inventory shortage but said it was the major reason for the decline in earnings. A decline in gross margin percentage and an increase in the effective tax rate also contributed to the downturn, Ames said.

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries, economists said. "The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in 1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be screaming at those countries about their exports," said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S. after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest. Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress, the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade. The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods. U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year. But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack. "In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing," said Robert Chandross, of Lloyds Bank PLC. Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986. The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion. And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6 billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago. Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation. Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987. The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the area of "big-ticket" manufactured goods, notably cars. Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985. "The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers," said Bob Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp. The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports, 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment. A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S. While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries. But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says. Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to 18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion. Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S. "A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been at Japan's expense," said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp. February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies. But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work with a sizeable lag, economists say. The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct. But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say. "We've not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes," said Bethlehem Steel's Wendt. And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect. Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will get given the administration's free-trade stance. "It's hard to see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then the question is, will it have teeth?" one economist said.  
HEAVY SIGNUP SEEN IN 1987 CORN PROGRAM - USDA With less than a week remaining to enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, Agriculture Department officials said that final signup will probably exceed last year's level of 85 pct. Enrollment in USDA's basic acreage reduction program will likely total close to 90 pct, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, ASCS, officials said, with 50 to 70 pct of the enrolling farmers also expected to sign up for the paid land diversion program. The signup period of the 1987 feedgrains program officially ends at the close of the business day on March 30. USDA will release its official signup report around April 15, an official said. USDA personnel in the corn belt states of Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana have been reporting heavy signup activity, an ASCS official told Reuters. A surge of acitivity is expected during this final week of signup, the official said. "A lot of farmers have been dragging their feet because they were anticipating some changes in the program, but that doesn't look very likely now," he said. To enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, farmers have to set aside 20 pct of the program acreage base, and have the option to idle an additional 15 pct under a paid land diversion program.

JAPAN HAS LITTLE NEW TO OFFER IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE The Japanese government appears to have little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said. The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the microchip trade signed last September. A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters "Japan has done what it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait for those steps to take effect." The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September agreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S. Chip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17. Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in third countries at non-regulated prices. "I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has," said Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods. Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they would consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in imports was not likely. Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be levied on consumer electronics products rather than on microchips themselves. "If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time, there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States," said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co. "The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be delayed for another year," he said. Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here. "The American approach is full of contradictions," Jardine Fleming's Edwards said. "If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that hurts the final market," Edwards said. But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S. Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also frustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analysts argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact. Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd, said "The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic economy and move away from an export-dependent economy."

VENEZUELA MOVES CLOSER TO CHAMPLIN PURCHASE the council of ministers approved petroleos de venezuela's planned purchase of a half interest in the champlin petroleum refinery at corpus christi, texas, government sources said. The cabinet authorized energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti to approve the purchase in the shareholders assembly of the state oil company petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa). Pdvsa last april 14 signed a letter of intent to buy a half interest in champlin's corpus christi refinery for an undisclosed sum. Under the terms of the provisional agreement, venezuela would supply up to 160,000 barrels a day to the plant through a new company which would be jointly owned by the pdvsa and champlin, a subsidiary of the union pacific corp &lt;unp>. The deal would also allow pdvsa a joint share in champlin's refinery and distribution network. The purhcase is one of a series of overseas joint ventures by which venezuela has managed to assure markets for some 400,000 barrels of its approximately 1.5 mln bpd exports. Hernandez grisanti told reporters after the cabinet meeting that pdvsa will pay 93 mln dlrs for its half ownership in the champlin refinery - 33 mln dlrs in cash and 60 mln dlrs crude oil and products. Through the deal, he said, venezuela will be assured the sale of at least 140,000 bpd of crude and products. Hernandez said pdsva has entered similar joint ventures with veba oel of west germany, nynas petroelum in sweden, and citgo in the united states.  
USDA SAID UNLIKELY TO BROADEN CORN BONUS OFFER The U.S. Agriculture Department probably will not offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to corn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the conservation reserve program last year, an aide to USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said. Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said yesterday that Lyng had indicated he would consider giving those farmers the same two dlr bonus offered corn farmers who are signing up for the 1987 program this month. But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that the department would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers who enrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year. "How are you going to stop the tide," he said, referring to demands that would follow from other commodity groups.

U.S. MARKET LOAN NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE-BOSCHWITZ A marketing loan for U.S. wheat, feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplus production situation and would be extremely costly, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) said. "I think I would not support a marketing loan now," he told the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains. Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a marketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focused support on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill. A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage more production, especially in high-yielding areas, would be much more expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loans and not increase exports significantly, he said.

ENERGY/FOREIGN INVESTORS Lured by the weakening dollar and the conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, European energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves to replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said. They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable United States is good insurance against future shortages. However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up competition among European firms, well-heeled U.S. institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice domestic oil properties. Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil and gas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyers had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. All buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for acquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five dlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research. "Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but we're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in," said Arthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn. "Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries," he added. Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to buy new reserves than to explore for them. Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and general restructuring throughout the oilpatch. In two of the biggest transactions of recent months, French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of &lt;Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to separately acquire oil assets of Texas International &lt;TEICC> and Lear Petroleum Partners &lt;LPP>. A spokesman for Minatome said the company is searching for additional acquisitions. A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, &lt;Petrofina S.A.> and &lt;Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos &lt;WMB>, the Oklahoma pipeline firm. But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's &lt;Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's &lt;TX> Texaco USA in a 100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with Dupont's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal. Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, its geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions than relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula. Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representing International Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of &lt;Preussag Corp> and &lt;C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm had earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months. But he called that a small amount compared to the amount other investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's Geodyne Energy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties. "The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil companies," he said. "Our company is shopping around because we feel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. If you're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need prices higher than the current market," he added. In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage houses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also competing for prime properties. Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying and selling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired two billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said. "Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these companies," Smith said. "Domestic production has dropped by one mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988."  
PHH &lt;PHH> BUYS TWO DESIGN FIRMS PHH Group Inc said it acquired two design firms for undisclosed terms. In 1986, the two firms, Neville Lewis Associates of New York and Walker Associates Inc of L.A., produced 15.6 mln dlrs in total fees.  
CISTRON BIOTECHNOLOGY &lt;CIST> SETS DIVIDEND Cistron Biotechnology Inc said it will pay a stock dividend declared prior to the initial public offering of its common stock in August 1986 to stockholders of record prior to the common offering. Payment of the dividend was contingent on the closing bid price of the common stock averaging two dlrs or more per shares for the trading days within any consecutive ten day period ending before February 29, 1988. The company said that the contingency has been fulfilled. Payment of the stock dividend increases Cistron's outstanding common stock to 21,390,190 shares from 16,185,354 shares.  
DOLLAR DROP SEEN AS TEST OF PARIS AGREEMENT The sharp drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test of last month's Group of Five (G-5) plus Canada agreement to stabilise currencies, dealers and bank economists said. "The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated central bank intervention," one dealer for a German bank said, echoing widepread sentiment in the market. But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged in Paris still exists. Some dealers said there were growing signs the United States wanted the dollar to fall further. Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention, the dollar plunged to a post-war low in Tokyo today. It was quoted as low as 148.40 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they expected the U.S. Currency to decline further. "The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen range," Chase Bank AG's senior dealer Eckhart Hager said. Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp dollar drop. "Window-dressing" operations by some Japanese companies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining the U.S. Currency. Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was not technical. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's comment the Paris accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a renewed attempt by the U.S. Administration to talk the dollar down. "Suddenly, support levels which had existed for fear of central bank intervention disappeared," one dealer said. The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 1.5 billion dlrs, and this with comments by Japanese officials indicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge, dealers said. Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank intervention if necessary. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the time had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last month to stabilise currencies - Japan, Britain, Canada, France, the U.S. And West Germany - to take action in line with the pact. But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were not detected in the open market during the European morning. Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act. While some said the West German central bank would support the dollar once it fell below 1.80 marks, others said the Bundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 1.75 marks or if the decline accelerated. The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27, when the dollar threatened to fall below 1.81 marks. "The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment," one dealer said. Others said cooperation between central banks and governments was easier said than done. Some said Baker's remarks and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter's warning that the U.S. And Japan were on the verge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift. "It's hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands," a dealer said. Another added, "If the Americans do not get what they want, they will push the dollar down, regardless of G-6." Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for the Paris agreement in its latest investment letter. "It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or able to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the necessary U.S. Fiscal contraction," Citibank said. It added, "Markets should therefore be aware that 1.80 marks is not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 1.70 marks or even less is expected this year." And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987 economic report, "We are looking for a further, more gradual, fall, possibly to 1.60 marks by the end of the year." But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in force was not universal. Some dealers said not too much should be read into Baker's and Yeutter's comments. "There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken down," a senior dealer said.

COOPER DEVELOPMENT &lt;BUGS> RESTATES RESULTS Cooper Development Co said it revised results for the year ended October 31 to a loss of 61.7 mln dlrs, or 2.33 dlrs per share, down from the previously-reported loss of 12.1 mln dlrs, or 46 cts per share. The restatement was made because of change in the method of accounting for a combination of several company-controlled concerns that resulted in a 53.5 mln dlr charge, Cooper Development said. Last August Cooper Development combined its Cooper Biomedical Inc unit and its Cooper Laboratories subsidiary with Technicon Instruments Corp, a company acquired from Revlon Inc &lt;REV>, a Cooper spokesman said. The spokesman said the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition, but the Securities and Exchange Commission took issue with the accounting method and said it should be accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control. This treatment requires that the costs associated with the transaction be expanded rather than capitalized as an intangible asset, the company said. It also said that, since the charged required an expensing of previously accrued liabilities, the company will experience no resulting material change it its cash flow.

GREAT AMERICAN &lt;GTAM> SEES CHARGE, WRITEDOWN Great American Corp said preliminary findings by regulatory examiners of its AMBANK subsidiary will result in a first quarter charge of 14.1 mln dlrs and a writedown of 1.4 mln dlrs. The charge will be made against the allowance for possible loan losses, and the writedown is of other real estate. Great American said the examiners were conducting a regular examination and a final report is not expected for several weeks. Management intends to include the charge and writedown in response to the preliminary findings. Great American said regulatory authorities are not requiring an adjustment of the previously reported financial results for Great American for 1986. However, Great American has revised its previous estimates of provisions for possible losses and has added 9.9 mln dlrs to the allowance account as of December 31, 1986. It said it took the action since the charge-offs will significantly deplete its allowance for possible loan losses and the economic environment does not show signs for significant improvement in the near future. It said the additional provision increases the allowance to 26.4 mln dlrs, representing 6.63 pct of the outstanding loan portfolio and 83.2 pct of non-performing loans at year-end. Great American said its revised net loss for the fourth quarter is 14.1 mln dlrs, or 6.36 dlrs per share, compared to a net loss of 2.4 mln dlrs or 1.06 dlrs per share the year earlier.

KLM EXPANDS TALKS WITH BRITISH AND COMMONWEALTH KLM Royal Dutch Airways &lt;KLM.AS> said it agreed to take full control of a partially owned Dutch-based parcel delivery service and will offer a minority stake in it to British and Commonwealth Shipping Plc &lt;BCOM.L> KLM, seeking to strengthen its market position in the fast growing door-to-door delivery market, said it agreed with Dutch retailer Vendex International &lt;VENN.AS> to take over Vendex's 50-pct in their jointly-owned courier, &lt;XP System VOF>. Ownership of XP will now be brought into the talks started by KLM last week with British and Commonwealth for a one-third stake in the latter's &lt;IML Air Services Group Ltd> courier. When announcing the negotiations with British and Commonwealth last week, KLM said buying a minority stake in IML could involve a convertible loan issue. A KLM spokeswoman said the Dutch flag carrier would now offer a minority stake in XP to British and Commonwealth in the negotiations on IML, but declined to elaborate on financial aspects of the talks. She said KLM would like the two courier services to cooperate in future and did not exclude a future merger between them to combine IML's strong world-wide network with XP's mainly European activities. XP System is based in the southern Dutch airport of Maastricht and has an annual turnover of 100 mln guilders. KLM, which is also negotiating with British and Commonwealth for a 15-pct stake in the latter's regional airline &lt;Air U.K. Ltd>, says door-to-door delivery courier services are seeing substantially faster growth than traditional cargo activities.  
EC MUST EXPLAIN FARM POLICY TO U.S., FRANCE SAYS The U.S. and the European Community could enter into a new trade dispute unless urgent action is taken to explain EC farm policy to the U.S. Congress, French official sources said. They said Prime Minister Jacques Chirac planned to urge EC Commission president Jacques Delors to send a team of experts to Washington as soon as possible. Chirac returned to Paris this morning after three days of talks in New York and Washington in which trade and protectionism featured prominently. At the centre of the new trade tension is an EC Commission proposal to tax vegetable oils, the sources said.  
LLOYDS BANK MATCHES BASE RATE CUT TO 10.5 PCT Lloyds Bank Plc said it is cutting its base lending rate to 10.5 pct from 11 pct, effective tomorrow. The reduction follows similar moves from the three other British clearing banks. National Westminster Bank Plc led the way this morning after the Bank of England lowered its dealing rates in a signal that it would tolerate a half percentage point reduction. The central bank's surprise signal followed its strenuous efforts last week to prevent market forces from bringing down base rates before the U.K. Budget on March 17.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group, led by Mutual Shares Corp, said it sold 60,000 Cyclops common shares since February 26.  
B.C. RESOURCES HAS AGREEMENT ON CREDIT FACILITY &lt;British Columbia Resources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full year operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a four year term. The company said the credit facility is extendable under certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals and completion of formal documentation. It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs. B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2 preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain suspended. However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said. Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred shareholders, with payment expected in early April to shareholders of record March 31, the company said. If future dividends are not declared after the April exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast Transmission Co &lt;WTC>, B.C. Resources said. The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British Columbia. B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and gas interests by 67 pct owned &lt;Westar Mining Ltd>. B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the company said. The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C. Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and exposure to the fluctuating pulp market. It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changes and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs.  
ALLEGHENY BEVERAGE &lt;ABEV> EXPLORES UNIT SALE Allegheny Beverage Corp said it has been approached by a group interested in acquiring its foodservice unit, Service America Corp. The group includes senior management of Service America but no officers of Allegheny Beverage, the company said. The company has agreed to permit the group and its potential lenders to perform a due diligence review of Service America, it said. Allegheny noted it had previously cancelled plans to spin off the foodservice subsidiary. The company said the group's review is preliminary and there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal will be made or, if made, accepted. Service America had fiscal 1986 revenues of about 934 mln dlrs, or about 83 pct of Allegheny Beverage's total revenues of 1.13 billion dlrs for the year ended March 29, 1986, a spokesman for Allegheny Beverage said. He declined to identify the Service America officials in the acquisition group. On Feb 18, 1987, Allegheny said it was cancelling the spin off of Service America, but gave no reason for doing so. It said it would place major emphasis on managing Service America to improve operations and increase earnings at the unit. Service America, which Allegheny acquired in May 1985, operates cafeterias and food and beverage vending machines. Through other subsidiaries, Allegheny provides coin-operated laundry services, building maintenance services and retail office and furniture operations. In fiscal 1986, Allegheny reported earnings from continuing operations of 8.2 mln dlrs or 1.09 dlrs a fully diluted share, excluding income of 59.7 mln dlrs from discontinued operations and an extraordinary loss of 8.1 mln dlrs. In May 1985, Allegheny sold its Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co unit to Pepsico Inc &lt;PEP> for 160 mln dlrs. Including discontinued operations and the special item, net income was 59.8 mln dlrs or 6.21 dlrs a share fully diluted.

CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW> REJECTS SOSNOFF'S OFFER Caesars World Inc said its board unanimously rejected a 28 dlr a share takeover offer by New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff. Caesars said Sosnoff's offer to by all its outstanding shares of common stock was inadequate and not in the best interests of its shareholders. The company recommended that shareholders reject Sosnoff's offer, made through his &lt;MTS Acquisition Corp>, and not tender any of their shares. Caesars said it will explore a variety of alternative transactions but did not elaborate. Caesars, in a brief statement, did not say whether it would seek to buy back its shares held by Sosnoff. A Caesars spokesman said the company would not comment further on its decision. On Wednesday, Sosnoff told the Securities and Exchange Commission that he controls 13.6 pct of the company's stock. Sosnoff also informed the SEC that Caesars had offered to buyout his holdings several times during the past year. No one from the Sosnoff organization was immediately available for comment. Caesars said its financial advisor, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, had determined that Sosnoff's offer was financially inadequate for shareholders other than Sosnoff. The company said other factors it considered in rejecting the offer were its financial condition, future prospects, current market conditions and the numerous conditions on which Sosnoff's bid was conditioned. Caesars' stock opened up 1/8 point at 28-1/8. That is 1/8 point above Sosnoff's offer price.

ZAMBIAN MINISTER CONFIRMS COPPER DIVERSION Minister of Mines Patrick Chitambala confirmed that Zambia had ended copper shipments through South Africa and announced that its state-run mining company had closed down its liaison office in the white-ruled republic. He told the official Times of Zambia newspaper in an interview the government was diverting all mineral exports along rail routes to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Beira in Mozambique. Chitambala declined to say what volume of copper and other minerals were being shipped through these two ports, but he said there had not been any problem with the new arrangements. "So far our copper has been reaching its destinations without hindrance," he told the Times. The Times of Zambia quoted unnamed sources as saying Zambia exported 100,000 tonnes of copper through Dar es Salaam and 17,000 through Beira in the last quarter of 1986. Diplomatic sources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia's ability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaam without causing massive bottlenecks at the ports. Chitambala also said that the state-run Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) had closed its liaison office in Johannesburg, since it was now redundant.

TAIWAN'S SECOND QUARTER IMPORTS SEEN RISING Taiwan's imports in the second quarter of 1987 are expected to rise to 7.75 billion U.S. Dlrs from 5.82 billion a year earlier and from 6.95 billion in the first quarter of this year, the statistics department said. A department official attributed the increase to growing domestic investment by the private and public sectors. It is expected to rise to 4.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from 3.79 billion a year earlier and 3.41 billion during the first quarter. Taiwan's exports in the April-June quarter are expected to rise to 12.03 billion U.S. Dlrs from 9.63 billion a year earlier and 11.28 billion in the first quarter. The official said Taiwan's trade surplus is expected to climb to 4.28 billion U.S. Dlrs in the second quarter of 1987 from 3.81 billion a year earlier. It was 4.33 billion in the first quarter of this year. Most of the surplus is expected to come from trade with the U.S., Taiwan's largest trading partner and importer of nearly 50 pct of Taiwan's total exports, he said. He said he expected Taiwan's imports, including grains, machinery and power plant equipment, from the U.S. To rise sharply because of government efforts to balance trade with Washington.

SOVIET TIMECHARTERING BOOSTS GRAIN FREIGHT RATES Current interest by Soviet charterers in taking Panamax vessels on timecharter, mainly from the U.S. To carry grain, is seen as the chief factor behind the recent surge in values on the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange (BIFFEX), dealers said. Futures soared through the 1,000 points barrier today for the first time in the spot position since the market opened in May 1985. However, the market tends to be nervous, with values some 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index, which is calculated on spot physical rates. No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings but they have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage (about 50,000 to 65,000 tonnes dw) from the U.S. Gulf which would normally operate on the trip to Japan, dealers said. "It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effect on its (the Soviet) grain harvest than reported," one said. Freight rates on the Gulf/Japan grain route have subsequently been the main beneficiary of current chartering conditions, with very few, if any, Panamax sized ships left for the remainder of this month in the Gulf. Rates have risen steadily for vessels loading next month. Dealers said there is even talk that owners are considering taking older vessels out of lay-up to meet current demand. Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chinese operators may be in the market for similar timecharter business later in the year, they said. They anticipate this would appear around June and it has prompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract, despite it normally being a slack time in the shipping year. Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks. Rates turned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices, which had supported the market at the start of the year, faltered but then recovered on the reported Soviet interest.

OPEC WITHIN OUTPUT CEILING, SUBROTO SAYS Opec remains within its agreed output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied: "Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)." He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters." Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together.

ECUADOR SAYS SUSPENDS OIL EXPORTS DUE EARTHQUAKE Ecuador today suspended its crude oil exports indefinitely due to an earthquake last night that damaged pumping and crude transport installations, an Energy and Mines MInistry statement said. It said the state oil firm Corporacion Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana (CEPE) notified foreign customers that it was declaring force majeure on its crude exports due to the tremor. Ecuador"s OPEC oil output quota is 210,000 barrels per day (bpd). A senior energy ministry official said that one pumping station at El Salado on Ecuador's main pipeline was damaged. He also said an 180 metre section of the pipeline attached to the bridge over the Aguarico river collapsed. The pumping station was about 20 km from the Reventador volcano, near the epicentre of the quake, which Ecuadorean seismologists said registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The Aguarico bridge was also close to the volcano, he said. The quake struck northern Ecaudor and southern Colombia, according to Ecuadorean officials. No injuries were reported.

NORMAL WORK RESUMES AT NEW ZEALAND PORTS Normal work has resumed at New Zealand ports as negotiations between harbour board workers and employers continue. Wellington Harbour Board Workers' Union secretary Ross Wilson told reporters talks late yesterday ended with agreement to take unresolved issues before an industrial conciliator. Wilson said the only remaining issue is the length of the union award. The dispute originally was about wage rates and the form of industry negotiations. Cook Strait ferry sailings resumed after Marlborough Harbour Board workers returned to work this morning, ending their industrial action a day early. The Waterside Workers' Federation, which struck for most of last week and held more than one mln tonnes of shipping in ports, meets on Monday and Tuesday in conciliation with the Waterfront Employers' Association. Union Secretary Sam Jennings said: "We've got two days of talks. If it's not all cleaned up by then ... I don't know what will happen."  
U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST REVISED DOWN The Bank of England said it had revised its forecast of the shortage in the money market down to 450 mln stg before taking account of its morning operations. At noon the bank had estimated the shortfall at 500 mln stg.  
TREASURY BALANCES AT FED FELL ON MARCH 10 Treasury balances at the Federal Reserve fell on March 10 to 2.842 billion dlrs from 3.073 billion dlrs the previous business day, the Treasury said in its latest budget statement. Balances in tax and loan note accounts fell to 9.828 billion dlrs from 11.418 billion dlrs on the same respective days. The Treasury's operating cash balance totaled 12.670 billion dlrs on March 10 compared with 14.490 billion dlrs on March 9.  
ENERGY/U.S. OIL OUTPUT Energy Secretary John Herrington has proposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he said all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close White House scrutiny before action is taken. One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods. Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year. The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending the tax code, but would look at the proposal. Herrington's proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy department's report on energy and the national security. The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security. He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria--increase production, not cause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer. Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test, spurring production but fail the second and third. He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oil prices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs. A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production. In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax. Options which meet Herrington's criteria include: - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs. - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000 barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year. - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a day, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs. - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs. Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration proposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily. He also called again for Congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which may hold nine billion barrels. Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/security study would make a strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry. Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even though it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to raise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000. This, he said, would further bolster national security in case of an oil-supply disruption.  
EXXON (XON) SEES SYNFUELS ROLE BY YEAR 2000 Development of costly shale oil, liquified coal and other kinds of synthetic fuels, halted in recent years because of cheap and abundant petroleum supplies, will become economic again when world oil prices top 30 dlrs a barrel, an Exxon Co USA executive said. Joe McMillan, a senior vice president, told Reuters after addressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, "By early in the next century, synthetics should play a significant role in this country's energy supply." McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that he believed synthetic fuels would become economic to develop when world oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range. "You're talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oil prices, but I think that time is coming and we've got to be prepared," McMillan said. He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pct annually in the next few years while the nation fails to replace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn of the century, world oil prices will be significantly higher because of declining supplies, McMillan said. Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at the meeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help spur development of synthetic fuels. The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tons of demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple that of all the world's known oil reserves. "We must encourage research now in order to make synfuels competitive later," Hall said. The average lead time for development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between five and ten years. Until last year, the federal government had subsidized synfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., a research program created during the Carter Administration with the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels of oil. The corporation was shut down last April when Congress refused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budget because of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs a barrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade.

GUINNESS STARTS COURT ACTION AGAINST SAUNDERS Guinness Plc &lt;GUIN.L> said it has started court proceedings against former chairman and chief executive Ernest Saunders and non-executive director Thomas Ward for recovery of 5.2 mln stg. The money was paid to Ward via Marketing and Acquisition Consultants Ltd in Jersey. Guinness said earlier it would propose a resolution at the annual meeting in May to remove Saunders and Ward as directors of the company.  Earlier this month, lawyers for Ward told a Jersey court that Ward saw the payment as his reward for services in last year's takeover battle for &lt;Distillers Co Plc>. Guinness has said that both men breached their fiduciary duty in authorising the payment. Saunders resigned from his executive positions at Guinness in January in the aftermath of a government enquiry into share dealings during the battle for Distillers but retained his position on the board. No spokesman for Guinness was immediately available for comment on the statement.

BRUNSWICK &lt;BC> SEES HIGHER 1987 FIRST QUARTER Brunswick Corp expects 1987 first quarter sales to be up "dramatically" and profits to "do well," chairman and president Jack Reichert said after a securities analysts meeting. He declined to be more specific. In the 1986 first quarter, Brunswick reported earnings of 23.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a share on sales of 396.7 mln dlrs. Reichart noted that results of its two newly-acquired boat manufacturing companies will be included in the company's first quarter report. Brunswick expects its recreation centers to benefit from increased attention to the sport of bowling resulting from acceptance in the 1988 Summer Olympics of bowling as an exhibition sport and as a medal sport in the 1991 Pan American Games, he said. He said field testing of a new bowling concept involving electronic features is being readied for test marketing this summer, and if successful, could "materially benefit" operations. Brunswick is currently test marketing in California a health club facility adjoining a bowling center, he said. Turning to its defense operations, Reichert said he expects the division to receive significant contracts in the near future. At 1986 year end, Brunswick's defense contract backlog stood at 425 mln dlrs. Frederick Florjancic, vice president-finance, told analysts Brunswick was disappointed two credit rating services recently downgraded the company's debt which stood at about 665.4 mln dlrs at 1986 year end. "We are confident we can service our debt and bring it down in the very near term," based on strong cash flow from Brunswick's expanded boat operations, Florjancic said. Shareholders at the company's April 27 annual shareholders meeting will be asked to approve an increase in the authorized common shares outstanding to 200 mln from 100 mln shares, a company spokesman said.  
&lt;D'OR VAL MINES LTD> FINDS HIGH-GRADE ORDER D'Or Val Mines Ltd said a recent drill hole from the surfrace has intersected high-grade ore in a downdip extension of the Discovery Vein in its D'Or Val Mine in northern Quebec. The company said 42.3 feet of the hole graded 0.92 ounce per short ton of gold, including a 17.5 foot section grading 2.17 ounces. It said the zone is just below the projection of the seventh level of the mine about 1,450 feet below the surface and 820 feet west of the shaft. D'Or Val said this find and other recent ones will make substantial contributions to the mine's ore reserves and grade.  
DANISH TRADE IN BALANCE IN FEBRUARY Denmark's balance of payments on current account was provisionally put at zero in February, against a 181 mln crown surplus in January and a 1.5 billion deficit in February 1986, the National Statistics Office said. Exports rose to 13.94 billion crowns in February from 12.53 billion in January, against 14.16 billion in February last year. February imports rose to 13.94 billion from 12.35 billion in January, against 15.67 billion in February 1986. The February figure provisionally gives a trade surplus for 1987 of 180 mln crowns, against a 3.04 billion deficit in the same 1986 period.  
CANADIAN MONEY SUPPLY FALLS IN WEEK Canadian narrowly-defined money supply M-1 fell 291 mln dlrs to 32.44 billion dlrs in the week ended March 25, Bank of Canada said.

BRAZIL TEMPORARILY LEGALISES DLR PARALLEL MARKET Brazilian President Jose Sarney announced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase of U.S. dollars in the parallel currency market, aimed at promoting imports of foreign goods. In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face "current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for the purchase of goods." The parallel market, although officially tolerated, is technically illegal in Brazil. For the past year, the dollar in the parallel market has sold at between 25 and 100 pct above the official rate. Sarney's decision means Brazilian importers of machinery and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in the parallel market without having to wait for an official order from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex). Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an effort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviate the risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the economy. The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council (CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil's trade policy, with participation of the private sector. The Council had been closed three years ago by the military government of former President Joao Figueiredo.  
ITALIAN WHOLESALE PRICES UP 1.1 PCT IN JANUARY The wholesale price index rose 1.1 pct month-on-month in January 1987 after increasing by 0.3 pct in December 1986, the national statistics institute Istat said. The index, base 1980 equals 100, registered 172.8 in January compared with 170.9 in December. The January 1987 figure represents a fall over January 1986 of 1.7 pct after a year-on-year decrease in December 1986 of 2.5 pct.  
UAE GOVERNMENT PAPER YIELDS UNCHANGED Yields on certificates of deposit issued by the United Arab Emirates Central Bank were unchanged at 6-1/8 pct, the bank said. The yield applies to maturities of one, two, three and six months.  
JAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT Japan's unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953. "There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions. "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving," a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years.

SEIPP SAYS GERMAN INTEREST RATES SHOULD FALL The Bundesbank should take further steps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark from further appreciation and to persuade investors to bring long-term yields lower, Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> management board chairman Walter Seipp said. But he told the bank's annual news conference this did not mean a cut in leading interest rates, rather a reduction in money market rates through bringing the allocation rates down for Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements. "Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates," he said. "The money market rates are the important ones." Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocating money market liquidity at a fixed 3.8 pct as it has in recent tender allocations. An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss of credibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetary growth. A fall in short rates would make the public aware of the high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capital formation, braking the expansion of money supply. "Thus, you can have lower rates and also a normalisation of monetary growth both at the same time," he added. Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black a picture of the German economy, since company profitability had improved over recent years and domestic oriented firms were profiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark. Growth this year should be at least one pct, he said, describing the downturn in production in the first months as a false start, unrepresentative of the rest of the year. After an economic contraction in the first quarter, the economy should show an uptrend in the last three. "We don't believe that the economy has tipped over, but see it more as a 'growth dip,'" Seipp said. But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscal policy, saying the top rate of income and corporate tax should be brought down to 49 pct. The current peak rate is 56 pct. The additional tax cuts brought forward to next January were no substitute for support for growth. Seipp added the federal government should make "further courageous steps to decrease the state's proportion of the German economy and to increase its flexibility."  
DUTCH PORT UNION CALLS OFF GENERAL CARGO STRIKES Dutch port and transport union, FNV, has called off the strikes against planned redundancies that have hit Rotterdam port's general cargo sector for the past eight weeks, strike leader Paul Rosenmuller told a mass meeting. The decision followed yesterday's ruling by an Amsterdam court preventing the sector's employers continuing with current plans for 350 redundancies this year until the court sits again on May 7, Rosenmuller told a meeting of the general cargo sector's 4,000 workers today. The court ruled the employers had made a mistake in the complicated legal procedure for obtaining official permission for the redundancies, and therefore could not proceed. "There is no need to continue the strikes for the moment now the immediate pressure of redundancies has been lifted," Rosenmuller said. But he added that the strikes, which began on January 19 in protest against plans for 800 redundancies by 1990, could resume at any time before May 7 if the employers made any moves to re-apply for permission for the redundancies. SVZ labour relations manager Gerrard Zeebregts said they would be meeting their lawyers today with a view to re-applying for this permission next week in the hope of gaining approval for the redundancies within a month.

DROUGHT MAY REDUCE ZIMBABWE COFFEE OUTPUT -GROWERS Zimbabwe's projected coffee output of 13,000 tonnes for 1987/88 could be reduced by drought, growers said. The main coffee growing areas in eastern Zimbabwe have received little rain since April 1986 and the Coffee Growers' Association has begun a survey to assess the effects of the drought, a spokesman said. Zimbabwe exported 11,000 tonnes of coffee in 1986, mainly to West Germany, Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States.  
UNION TO PROTEST DART'S SUPERMARKETS &lt;SGL> BID The United Food And Commercial Workers said that more than 1,000 rank-and-file members of the union will demonstrate Monday at Dart Group Corp's headquarters protesting Dart's proposed 1.73 billion dlr takover of Supermarkets General &lt;SGL>. Supermarkets is best known for its Pathmark chain of supermarket drug stores in the New York and New Jersey area and also owns Rickels home centers. The union said that it is firmly against the Dart bid because "workers have always ended up with a raw deal in the current takeover mania." A Union statement said: "We do not intend to allow our members to pick up the tab for Supermarket General's executives and the bankers or the Dart Group who stand to make millions." Dart is controlled by the Haft family of Washington, which last year made a bid for California-based Safeway Stores Inc. The Hafts lost, but walked away with at least 100 mln dlrs in profits, analysts estimate. The union said that Dart's Safeway bid forced a major restructuring at Safeway to pay the Hafts and their lawyers and caused a loss of thousands of jobs.  
ARMTEK &lt;ARM> SELLS TIRE, TRUCK TIRE BUSINESS Armtek Corp, formerly known as Armstrong Rubber Co, said it signed agreements with &lt;Condere Corp> for the sale of its Natchez, Miss. tire plant and its S and A Truck Tire Sales and Services Corp. Terms were not disclosed. Armtek spokesman John Sievers said S and A is a 50 mln dlr business. Earlier this week, Armtek announced the sale of its industrial tire and assembly business division to Dyneer Corp of Scotsdale, Ariz. Cash proceeds from both sales will be used to reduce outstanding debt. Under a long term supply agreement with Condere, it is anticipated that truck tires produced at the Natchez plant will be supplied to the Armstrong Tire Co, an Armtek operating company, the company said. The closing is scheduled to be concluded by March 31, it said.  
EC TO ABOLISH TAX ON SPANISH MAIZE EXPORTS The European Community Commission has decided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne imposed on exports of Spanish maize, Commission sources said. They said the tax, which applies to Spanish sales to EC and non-EC countries alike, would no longer be required on exports from Spanish ports south of Valencia. The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority's cereals management committee today. The tax had been introduced last September at the same time as a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports of maize to Spain from other EC member countries. The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into Spain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from being reexported back to them. The sources added that Spain had received no answer from the committee to its request that tenders be opened for the sale to third countries of 450,000 tonnes of maize. The request will be considered at the committee's next meeting, the commission sources said. Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes of maize this year, while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-EC producer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years.  
DUTCH PARLIAMENT OFFERS LITTLE HELP IN PORT ROW Dutch members of parliament said they could do little to help resolve the dispute over redundancies in Rotterdam port's general cargo sector and urged the union and employers to sort out their differences themselves. Both sides gave evidence to the all-party standing committee on Social Affairs today, but committee members said they saw little chance of parliamentary intervention. The dispute began on January 19 in protest at employers' plans for 800 redundancies from the 4,000-strong workforce, starting with 350 this year. The port and transport union, FNV, is to challenge the redundancies in an Amsterdam court tomorrow.  
EC MINISTERS EXTEND BEEF, MILK MARKETING YEARS European Community agriculture ministers agreed to extend the 1986/87 milk and beef marketing years to the end of May, Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker told a news conference. He said the reason for the two-month extension of the only EC farm product marketing years which end during the spring months was that it would be impossible for ministers formally to agree 1987/88 farm price arrangements before May 12. This is when the European Parliament is due to deliver its opinion on price proposals from the EC Commission.

ICO PACT UNLIKELY BY AUTUMN - ITALIAN ADVISER The prospects of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) reaching an agreement on coffee export quotas before September appear dim, Alberto Hesse, former president of the European Coffee Federation, said. "There is no real goodwill in certain delegations to go to quotas," Hesse, who advises the Italian Foreign Affairs Ministry on coffee issues, told Reuters. He declined to name the delegations. A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set quotas. The ICO executive board will meet from March 30 to April 1 but the full council is not due to meet again until September. "I am not optimistic about an agreement soon," Hesse said.

NATIONAL SAVINGS MOVE POINTS TO LOWER U.K. RATES U.K. Interest rates look set to move lower even after Monday's half-point cut in bank base rates to 10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension of a British National Savings issue yesterday. The Department of National Savings, effectively a Treasury Department unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launched in October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-year private investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman said the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the market. The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutes today of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, the second such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted. They said the near-instant sale of the entire new gilts issue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct downpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rates had to drop sooner rather than later. The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due 1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downward pressure on money market rates remained intact, with the bellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at 10-9-7/8 pct. It coincided with another strong sterling rally which pushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar. "That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed," said Stephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew; "It is an indication that the market believes rates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-point immediately after the budget (on March 17), and some people hope for more." Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the National Savings Department was "of considerable significance." It said, "the real message ... Is that the decks are being quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises." Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a reduction in mortgage lending rates. Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the National Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasury policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut. "National Savings has been competing too effectively with the building societies of late. Building society income has been depressed in recent months," he said. He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid on U.K. Inflation. Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain than in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after last year's 3.7 pct. Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer prices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rates would reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct. But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been complaining to the government about intense competition from National Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for early mortgage rate cuts. "The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR funding from National Savings, but he must be taking the building societies' criticism to heart. It looks like the National Savings move reflects this," one senior dealer said. A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this interpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely a reaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which had pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with the rest of the market. "We are not politically motivated ... Funding was just becoming too expensive and we don't need all that money," he told Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues at least twice in the past, when offered interest rates were above or below market rates. He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as U.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline and income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31. In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving's contribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg, compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of the previous year, official figures show. Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show a further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing the total for 11 months above target, government officials said.

BILZERIAN MAY SEEK CONTROL OF PAY 'N PAK &lt;PNP> Investor Paul Bilzerian disclosed he holds a 7.2 pct stake in Pay 'N Pak Stores Inc common stock and is considering seeking control of the retail building material firm. Bilzerian said he and a Tampa, Fla., investment firm he controls called Bicoastal Financial Corp "may acquire additional shares, or they may seek to acquire one or more positions on (Pay 'N Pak's) Board of directors or to acquire a controlling interest in the (company's) shares, by tender offer or otherwise." The statement was made in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bilzerian said his course of action would depend on the company's prospects, market conditions and other factors. Bilzerian said he and Bicoastal made net purchases of 515,600 shares on the New York Stock Exchange Jan 26-March 25. His 7.2 pct stake makes up a total of 722,000 shares.

BRITISH AIDE CRITICIZES U.S.PROTECTIONISM A senior British official said that protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the global trading system. Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian textile producers, "the community would have to retaliate." His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports. Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress. De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks. Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs. Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods. Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone problems - its surplus with the United States last year was 51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs. "The more united pressure there could be, the better," he said. Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to avoid trade disputes. He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards. "But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," he said, ""it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion." Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment in Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines." He said other potential conflicts are already in sight - alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United States must therefore learn to manage their relations better." He said another bill to let the United States retaliate against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S. goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices. He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not by the United States, adding "if the (trade) law is to be interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is to happen to the rest of us?"  
BIONOMIC SCIENCES &lt;BSII> SEES PROFITABILITY Bionomic Sciences International Inc said it expects to start operating profitably by the fourth quarter.

FINAL 50/50 CORN CERTS SEEN AT 1.6 BILLION DLRS The Agriculture Department will have to release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of in-kind certificates, or certs, to corn farmers this fall if USDA decides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain deficiency payments in cash and certs, USDA officials said. Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to feed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments for the 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50 cash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated they want to do the same for feedgrains. Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corn deficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42 billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final payment must be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split. However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs, doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs. Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitation from the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another huge release of certs onto the market. Bills are pending in Congress to move up the final feedgrain deficiency payment to "as soon as five months after harvest as possible," rather than the current year lag time. Neither Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill.) nor Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kans.), sponsors of the bills, have brought the legislation forward. Aides said timing will depend on budget discussions.

YEUTTER STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF TRADE TALKS U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter stressed the importance of trade negotiations to open foreign markets rather than trade restrictions in a statement to the Senate Finance Committee. "In the long term we cannot repeatedly bludgeon other nations into opening their markets with threats of U.S. restrictions. Rather, we must be able to negotiate credibly for global liberalization," Yeutter said. Yeutter did not mention the recent U.S. trade sanctions against Japanese semiconductors in his testimony on the pending trade bill. Yeutter said the trade bill should increase U.S. competitiveness, aid U.S. trade negotiating leverage, and avoid provoking foreign retaliation. He urged Congress to reject provisions that would mandate U.S. retaliation against foreign unfair trade practices. Yeutter emphasized the importance of the new multilateral trade negotiating round and called on Congress to quickly approve an extension of U.S. negotiating authority. "We want to open foreign markets and establish and enforce rules of international competition, not foster dependence on protection and subsidies," he said.  
THATCHER DEFENDS UK OIL POLICY IN SAUDI INTERVIEW British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that her government's oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil prices. She said the government was determined not to intervene to influence production decisions by oil companies operating in the North Sea. "We believe these must be a matter for the commercial judgment of the oil companies," she told the Arabic language daily al-Sharq al-Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit to London by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel. British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to increase in the future, she said. "We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility for both producer and consumer countries," Thatcher said. "On our part, we are careful to avoid any actions which might add to such volatility."

FRENCH GDP SHOULD RISE 2.3 PCT IN 1988 - MINISTRY French gross domestic product should grow by 2.3 pct in 1988 after two pct growth this year and 2.1 pct in 1986, the Finance Ministry said. The latest forecast, prepared by the National Accounts and Budget Commission, assumed an exchange rate of 6.20 francs to the dollar this year and next and an average oil import price rising to 18.9 dlrs a barrel next year from 17.4 dlrs this year and 14.7 in 1986. The Commission, headed by Finance minister Edouard Balladur, forecast a fall in consumer price inflation to two pct year-on-year at end-1988 from 2.4 pct at end 1987 and 2.1 pct last year. In annual average terms inflation would fall to two pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year and 2.7 pct last year, it said. Trade should show a one billion franc annual surplus this year and next after last year's 0.5 billion surplus, it added. Employment should rise by 0.1 pct a year over the next two years while the state budget deficit should be cut to 2.2 pct of GDP in 1988 from 2.6 pct this year and 2.9 pct in 1986. Other forecasts prepared by the Commission indicated a 1.8 pct 1988 rise in household purchasing power, up from 1.1 pct this year but less than last year's 2.9 pct, and a 1.6 pct rise in household consumption, compared with this year's 1.5 pct and last year's 2.9 pct. Business investment is forecast to rise four pct a year this year and next after 3.7 pct last year, with private sector productive investment rising 4.9 pct in 1988 after a six pct rise this year and 5.5 pct in 1986. The Ministry said updated forecasts would be prepared before the autumn to serve as the basis for the 1988 budget, which the government is now preparing for presentation in September.  
JAPAN OPENS HOME MARKET TO U.S. FISH Japan has agreed to drop barriers to American-caught herring and pollock, opening the way for shipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced. Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo. He said the Commerce Department estimated U.S. shipments of processed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mln dlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in later years. There was no immediate assessment of the value of current U.S. shipments, but officials said the pact would lift quotas to the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly all the pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms. At the same time, Yeutter said Washington was temporarily suspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of the two fish. He said the complaint would be reviewed later this year after an assessment to see if Japan lived up to the agreement.

CONFIDENCE IN OPEC FIRMS U.S. ENERGY FUTURES Renewed confidence in OPEC's ability to limit production helped U.S. energy futures settle above yesterday's closing prices, according to analysts. They also said the heating oil contract found additional support from a short-covering rally on the close. April crude closed 24 cts higher to 17.75 dlrs. April heating oil was 1.47 cts higher to 47.91 cts a gallon. "Most traders expected follow through profit-taking from yesterday but the market found suport from bullish reports that OPEC is producing within its quota," said Simon Greenshields, a vice president with Morgan Stanley and Co Inc. News today, including OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman statement that OPEC February production did not exceed its official quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day, helped bouy prices, traders said. A Reuter survey found OPEC production in early March was 14.7 mln bpd. In addition to short-covering, heating oil found support from traders buying it against sales of gasoline and crude, as well as from expectations for continued drawdowns in stocks as refiners shut down for maintenance, traders said. Unleaded gasoline for April finished 0.55 cent higher to 51.24 cts a gallon.

GATT ROUND MAY STOP GROWING TRADE PROBLEMS: U.S. A successful new GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient. "That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round," he said. "The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems." The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time. The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said. "Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round." But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries, but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years. "It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two," he said. "They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future," he said.

BALDRIGE SEES U.S. TRADE GAP DROPPING SOON Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the U.S. trade deficit should start to decline soon, possibly in the figures for February or March. "We could see the trade deficit start down in February or March," Baldrige said in an appearance before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. He predicted the trade deficit, which was 170 billion dlrs in 1986, would decline by 30 to 40 billion dlrs in 1987 and in 1988. Baldrige said he was making his prediction without having seen the February trade figures, but he said that the volume of imports has dropped beginning with the fourth quarter of 1986 and will continue to drop in this quarter. The eventual turnaround in the monthly trade figures will reflect the impact of the decline in the dollar, Baldrige said. Ealier, Treasury Secretary James Baker told the committee that the trade deficit had levelled off, but Baldrige said he was more optimistic, adding, "I think we turned the corner in February."  
CHEUNG KONG CHAIRMAN SEES STRONG RESULTS IN 1987 Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd &lt;CKGH.HK> is expecting strong results this year after reporting better than expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not give a specific earnings projection but he told reporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19 cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a four-for-one stock split. The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15 cents a share for 1986, adjusting for the stock split and bonus issue. Cheung Kong's earnings rose to 1.28 billion H.K. Dlrs in 1986, well above market expectations of 920 mln to one billion dlrs. They compared with profits of 551.7 mln dlrs in 1985. Cheung Kong also reported extraordinary gains of 983.6 mln dlrs mainly from the firm's sale of the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel to Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> for one billion dlrs. It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985. Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local property market and substantial increases in contributions from associated companies. "Looking ahead, 1987 should be another year of stability for the property market," Li said. "The growth in (Hong Kong's) exports is expected to stimulate the demand for industrial buildings." Cheung Kong is cash rich and is looking for new projects in the British colony, Li said, noting the firm is interested in a land reclamation project along the Hong Kong harbour and is exchanging views with the government on a proposal to build a second airport.  
CCC ACCEPTS EXPORT BONUS DAIRY CATTLE TO MOROCCO The Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, has accepted a bonus offer from an exporter on the sale of 13 head of dairy cattle to Morocco, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The department said the bonus awarded was 1,505.00 dlrs per head and was made to Brown Swiss Enterprises Inc. It will be paid in the form of commodities from CCC inventories. The cattle are for delivery during March 9-September 30, 1987. The department said the purchase completes the Export Enhancement Program initiative for dairy cattle to Morocco announced on April 16, 1986.  
TWA &lt;TWA> TANGLES PIEDMONT &lt;PIE> SITUATION Trans World Airlines Inc complicated the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy Piedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with Piedmont and USAir. Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin. TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price. TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the airlines. Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena. "We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else," said one arbitrager. "We think TWA might just be putting up a trial balloon." Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir, but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals. They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements. "They need to show their commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a credible offer," said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst. "I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals," said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers. USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock. USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln shares. Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding 65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp. Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of Piedmont. Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target. "Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines," said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming. "I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package," said Kim. But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load. Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do the offer. The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements. Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X> and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock. Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal. Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA offer on price and financing concerns. "It's littered with contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing arrangement," said one executive at another major airline. But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast, to the mix would develop an even stronger force.
